                <p>Today I was working with a co-worker, <a href="http://codemonkey.nmonta.com/">Nelson Montalvo</a>, and talking to him about my file transfer woes with moving this site and other sites to a new server.  Lots of files.  He mentioned a software package, <a href="https://www.foldershare.com/">FolderShare</a>, that I tried tonight and now believe I owe Nelson a steak dinner.  It is AWESOME!!</p>
<p>It is <strong><em>FREE</em></strong> and with a basic email login and password you can manage most of the connections online.</p>
<p>Once you download the client to your PC and to the server, in my case, you can initiate the sync.  I create a sync folder on each box and drop the files I want transferred into my laptop's sync folder.  After a little bit the server starts transfer.  It is secure and fast.</p>
<p><strong>How to Sync:</strong></p>

<p>According to the website, the only limitation is that the file sizes do not exceed 2GB.  There are unlimited file transfers and no restriction on types.  Oh yeah, and it's <strong><em>FREE.</em></strong></p>
<p>Don't take my word for it. Check it out.  Good job Microsoft (well, the acquisition MS did to get this product, they made it free and free is good).</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATED: Used the Code Snippet plug-in</em></strong></p>
<p>Layouts are like <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wtxbf3hh.aspx">master pages</a> or template pages in Adobe DreamWeaver.  They allow you to template your site.  I have a default.vm under my ../Views/layouts folder and the way to make a controller utilize the layout is to add a layout attribute to the class definition:</p>

<p>As you probably saw in my last post, it wasn't just a simple "hello world" text on a white background.  <br>
The reason I had a design was due to the ****<a href="http://api.castleproject.org/html/T_Castle_MonoRail_Framework_LayoutAttribute.htm">Layout attribute</a> on the ExampleController class.  <br>
Layouts are simply NVelocity files (or whichever viewing engine you chose) placed in the /Views/layouts folder.  In my case it is the default.vm file:</p>

<p>Precursor:  I'm not as much anti-Microsoft as I used to be, but this re-ignited the flame.  Not against Microsoft, but websites that don't want to hit all demographics.</p>
<p>I personally use Ubuntu at home on 2 of my computers (I also have 2 Windows XP Pro and 1 Windows 2003 Server SP2 boxes).  I switched my wife over to Ubuntu about 2 months ago.  She only uses her laptop for email, Internet and the occasional document/spreadsheet.  She uses gmail for email, so no application change there.  She used Firefox on Windows, again no change.  I introduced her to OpenOffice on Windows before the migration so she could used to it and therefore be able to continue writing documents and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>She loves to play games online and usually it's just java applets or flash/shockwave games.</p>
<p>She told me today that she had a site where she couldn't get the games to come up and I looked at the error screen and cringed. I thought the "this site requires Internet Explorer to run" was bad.  This one takes the cake.  "King.com requires Microsoft Windows".  The same site thinks that Shockwave is on its 99999 version.</p>
<p>I know, I know.  Run a virtual machine with windows and let her play the games for that site that way.  (<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=183209">HOWTO</a>)<br>
She's pretty computer savvy, so we'll be good.</p>
<p>Side note:  <a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/">BERYL</a>, is freaking awesome.  She only has 64 MB of video memory on her Dell Inspiron 1150 and it runs great.  (Yeah, I know I need to upgrade her soon.)  Beat that Vista.<br>
It was actually <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC5uEe5OzNQ">this subject and video</a>, that made my wife want to switch. :)</p>
<p>Ignore the "java Firefox plug-in" Google search in the browser.  I was too lazy to look harder than that @ 650am.</p>

                <p><em><strong>UPDATE: I am using the Castle MonoRail project trunk code, NOT RC2<br>
</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>REASONS:</strong></p>
<p>I've had a few friends ask me what is MonoRail and how do I set it up?  I decided to go from the ground up here.  There is nothing here that you can't get from the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/usersguide/installing.html">Castle website documentation</a>.  I just want to grok this stuff and like Mr. Torvalds says, "<a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132">Talk is cheap, show me the code</a>".  I also want to learn how to unit test in this environment.  I've heard the great things about Ruby on Rails (RoR from now on), but want to make that migration slowly.</p>
<p>Please don't laugh if this is too beginning for you.  I will eventually get to some advanced topics like:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03Monorail1_C9C5/image_thumb_6.png"></p>
<p>and much more after the scar tissue starts to gather (one mentioned below).Please be patient with me and if you are using MonoRail in production, please make sure I stay on the correct path (<a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joeydotnet/default.aspx">JoeyDotNet</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx">Scott Bellware</a> and the <a href="http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/default.aspx?GroupID=3">Dovetail team</a>, and <a href="http://devlicious.com/blogs/billy_mccafferty/default.aspx">Billy McCafferty</a> are a few that I know of).</p>
<p>Now we begin.</p>
<p><strong>SETUP:</strong></p>
<p>My current main folder structure in my source control (<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>) is like so:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03Monorail1_C9C5/image_thumb_2.png"></p>
<p>I also use <a href="http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/">Ankh</a> for my Subversion plug-in in Visual Studio 2005 (hence the green checkmarks in the image above and future images.)</p>
<p>I keep all my dependent libraries in the lib folder (yes, Jason, we're not morons...I know)</p>
<p>Once the default structure is setup, you need to setup your folders so that MonoRail will work properly:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03Monorail1_C9C5/image_thumb_4.png"></p>
<p>Notice the folder structure:</p>
<p>Project Root<br>
+Content<br>
-----css<br>
-----images<br>
+Controllers<br>
+Models<br>
+ViewComponents (future post)<br>
+Views<br>
-----components<br>
-----(matching controller named folders containing vm files)<br>
-----layouts (next post)<br>
-----rescues (next post)</p>
<p>This is all provided on the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/usersguide/installing.html">Castle website documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I am currently using shared hosting (<a href="http://www.webhost4life.com">WebHost4Life</a>) and it has served it's purpose.  I recently <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2007/08/11/monorail-on-webhost4life.aspx">posted</a> about how they added the .rails extension to the server so that I can feel more legitimate about using rails than having to use a different extension, explained <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/usersguide/installing.html#DeployingToSharedHost">here</a> and in <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2007/08/11/monorail-on-webhost4life.aspx">my previous post</a>.  The installation instructions on the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/usersguide/installing.html">Castle website documentation</a> are very user friendly.  I personally took the **<a href="http://www.castleproject.org/download/monorail/v1rc2/MonoRail.GettingStartedSampleVS2005.zip">sample solution**</a> and started from there.  It worked great.  Just build it locally and upload your web project to your web host.  I personally check into a subversion repository and use <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CruiseControl.NET</a> for my automated continuous integration and during that process my <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a> script handles deployment.</p>
<p><strong>I'M NOT A DESIGNER:</strong></p>
<p>No matter how hard I try to design sites, I can't make them appealing to the human eye.  I LOVE <a href="http://www.oswd.org">Open Source Web Designs</a>.  It has over 2000 designs and gives me a place to start.  The site I'm using, <a href="http://www.jasonmeridth.com">JasonMeridth.com</a>, for this example is create by <a href="http://www.nodethirtythree.com/">Node Thirty Three</a> (I firmly believe in giving the designers their dues) and know it will do it's job.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES TO PAY ATTENTION TO:</strong></p>
<p>If, sorry, <strong><em>when</em></strong> you setup your Test projects make sure to reference the correct assemblies needed for unit testing with MonoRail.  They are Castle.MonoRail.Framework, Castle.MonoRail.TestSupport, and my unit testing framework of choice is NUnit, so I reference nunit.Framework.  Also don't forget to reference the project you are unit testing.  In this case it is my JasonMeridth project.</p>
<p>I'm still trying out the abstract base test class that the Castle group has created, AbstractMRTestCase. </p>
<p><strong><em>TIP:</em></strong> Currently I've learned that if you do the following (This is only a serious rough draft, please no comments on test names or formatting):</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/#71" title="2007-08-29 10:14:44">Joey Beninghove</a>:</strong> Good stuff. This should definitely help more folks to start using MonoRail. I'm currently on my 3rd "professional" MonoRail project and I can't ever imagine having to go back to "classic" Web Forms. Also, regarding unit testing, you'll definitely want to check out the BaseControllerTest class (assuming you're working from the trunk, which I <em>do</em> recommend). BaseControllerTest is a much better way to drive out your controllers via TDD and I've used it successfully on my last 2 projects. Funny you mention RoR, because I'm actually in the process of learning Ruby (and Rails) on the side and I've just been blown away by it. I love the simplicity of MonoRail, but it truly is held down by being tied to the static languages of .NET. From what I've seen so far, that beauty in simplicity in RoR is 10-fold of what we can get with MonoRail on .NET. Anyways, btw, thx for the tip/link to Open Source Web Design. Hadn't seen them before. Looks like a great place for us creatively-challenged folks to get the design ideas bumping around in our heads.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/#72" title="2007-08-29 14:54:27">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Awesome!! Thanks Joey, I will check that BaseControllerTest class. I'm using the trunk. :) I will head down the RoR path soon, but baby steps for me. I look forward to any RoR posts from you in the future (hint, hint) :) OSWD is awesome. Glad I could get that out there.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/#73" title="2007-08-30 09:00:22">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> I have to agree with Joey here. I have done about three projects with Windosor/MonoRail as well and I couldn't imagine going back to WebForms. Someone would have to drag me kicking and screaming =)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/#74" title="2007-08-30 21:46:21">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> I'm starting to feel the same way with just the little I've done so far. I may be tapping into your knowledge later Sean. Thanks for the info.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/#75" title="2007-09-01 12:57:47">Joe</a>:</strong> Hey man, looks like a good post. You beat me to the punch, I've been working on a Monorail introduction myself. As for unit testing, that is actually no longer the recommended way to test. Check out this page http://using.castleproject.org/display/MR/TDDingControllers that shows the new recommendations for TDD with MR. The old way (inheriting from AbstractMRTestCase) is meant to be used internally. Keep up the great posts! Joe</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-1-reasons-setup-and-first-output/#76" title="2007-09-05 22:37:33">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Joe Thank you for that link. I appreciate the support. Post about MonoRail anyway bro, another perspective is always good.</p>

                <p>To all developers,</p>
<p>If you are located for co-located <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> hosting, I've now looked at, tried/purchased an account with <a href="http://www.svnrepository.com">SvnRepository.com</a>.  I was pair programming with a colleague today at a local coffee shop and we have both been trying to decide where we can host the code to handle remote pair programming or coffee shop pair programming.  My manager, Joe, had mentioned SvnRepository to me a while back and I hadn't made the choice yet.</p>
<p>After doing some research, the price, and no BS website helped make the decision.  Within 15 minutes after purchasing the account, I had a single repository, two logins and code uploaded.  SWEET!!</p>
<p>After making my initial purchase, the $3.95 package (one repository, unlimited developers), I got techno lust (as we know all software developers get when a new techie item is available) and sent an email to their help email account and asked if I could upgrade my account to the $7.95 account (unlimited repositories, unlimited developers).  Within 2 hours I had a response and my account was upgraded.</p>
<p>Also you can set the account up to email you when people check-in to the repository. :)</p>
<p>Excellent customer service.<br>
Great technical service delivered.</p>
<p>It's nice to find something that works out of the gates.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/svnrepository-com-rocks/#67" title="2007-08-31 13:46:37">Donn Felker</a>:</strong> I've been using SVNRepository.com for months now and I agree. It seriously kicks booo-tay.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/svnrepository-com-rocks/#68" title="2007-09-22 09:48:46">Jin Kwon</a>:</strong> Can I set user access per directory?</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/svnrepository-com-rocks/#69" title="2007-09-22 16:35:31">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Not that I can see. I will inquire. If it doesn't though, for ~$7/mo. you can have unlimited repositories. Are you asking for specific access to the same codebase but for different directories?</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/svnrepository-com-rocks/#70" title="2007-09-22 21:33:47">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> I like the idea of getting an e-mail when someone accesses the repository. This is a cool feature. I am currently running an ubuntu server at my house to run subversion but if I pick up some more developers this might be a viable option. Can't complain about the price. That is cheap!</p>

                <p>I'm currently in the process of moving the <a href="http://www.alamocoders.net">Alamo Coders</a> website to <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com">DotNetNuke</a> and I'm being introduced to the details of DNN.</p>
<p>By default, the RSS Module isn't HTML friendly.  However, by adding the following to an xsl tag:  </p>
<p>value-of disable-output-escaping="yes"</p>
<p><strong>Example:<br>
Before</strong>: <value-of select="description"></value-of><br>
<strong>After</strong>: <value-of disable-output-escaping="yes" select="description"></value-of></p>
<p>This allows for HTML encoding in your RSS feed.</p>
<p>Another formatting item is to limit the number of items that show in the module:</p>
<p>To show only the first 5 items:</p>
<p><if test="position() &lt; 6"><br>
        <br> <br>
        <strong><a href="posts/formatting-the-rss-module-in-dotnetnuke-to-handle-html-and-other-formatting-tips/%7Blink%7D" target="_main"><value-of select="title"></value-of></a></strong><br>
        <br> <br>
            <value-of select="pubDate"></value-of> <br>
        <br> <br>
</if></p>
<p>Another format to use is: </p>
<p><for-each select="channel/item[position() &lt; 6]"></for-each></p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else, like it helped me.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to get the items in the for-each loop to be able to grab it's channel's title while in the loop.  channel_title does not work.  Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/formatting-the-rss-module-in-dotnetnuke-to-handle-html-and-other-formatting-tips/#64" title="2007-08-15 18:07:46">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> That worked...Brain fart on my part. Thanks David. I guess the title is not what I wanted. I'm looking for the name of the blog that the item is coming from. I'm still searching to see what element constitutes that information. Example: I want the items to look like: J.D. Meridth : A blog entry about something. right now it does: Los Techies : A blog entry about something.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/formatting-the-rss-module-in-dotnetnuke-to-handle-html-and-other-formatting-tips/#65" title="2007-08-15 18:47:12">David Dobbins</a>:</strong> You got me on that one. Looking at the XML from feedburner for this page, I'm getting that your channel title is "J.D. Meridth". In fact, I don't see "Los Techies" (with the space) anywhere in the feed. Am I looking at the right feed?</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/formatting-the-rss-module-in-dotnetnuke-to-handle-html-and-other-formatting-tips/#66" title="2007-08-15 21:17:19">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> You are correct. I grabbed the RSS feed from the aggregate of all the LosTechies blogs. If I grab the feebburner from my blog, the channel name is correct. A friend has a console app that will aggregate multiple blog feeds together and then prepend the items with the correct channel title. An example is on http://adnug.org Thanks for the feedback David.</p>

                <p>If anyone else is using hosting with <a href="http://www.webhost4life.com">WebHost4Life</a>, I've gotten a Monorail site up there pretty quick using the MonoRailHttpHandlerFactory in my web.config, as suggested by the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/documentation/trunk/usersguide/installing.html#DeployingToSharedHost">Castle Monorail installation documentation</a>. <em> Please note that the documentation has .ashx, it should be .aspx</em>. </p>
<p>I've also put in a support ticket to see if <a href="http://www.webhost4life.com">WebHost4Life</a> will add the .rails extensions to the known ASP.NET extensions.  I'll update this post if it goes through.</p>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE:  <a href="http://www.webhost4life.com">WebHost4Life</a> was kind enough, after 2 help tickets, to add the .rails extension to the known ASP.NET extensions.  It works now.  They tried to get me to add a mime type for my specific domain (jasonmeridth.com) and that did not work.  Mime type of text/h</em></strong><strong><em>tml and extension of .rails failed.  If they ask you to do that, it will not work.</em></strong></p>
<p>If you're hosting company is not kind enough to add the extension, then the following will help:</p>
<p>With using the MonoRailHttpHandlerFactory, you just replace the .rails extension with .aspx. (Look at documentation link above)</p>
<p>Example: <a href="http://www.jasonmeridth.com/home/index.aspx">http://www.jasonmeridth.com/home/index.aspx</a>  instead of <a href="http://www.jasonmeridth.com/home/index.rails">http://www.jasonmeridth.com/home/index.rails</a></p>
<p>I've been working on a small website for a local San Antonio mom&amp;pop shop and decided to go with Monorail.  I'm not an expert by any means, just finally trying to grok this stuff.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-on-webhost4life/#58" title="2007-08-26 14:43:19">Glenn</a>:</strong> Freaky...I just put in the support request as well. Nice to know they'' do it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-on-webhost4life/#59" title="2007-08-26 16:14:20">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> If they tell you that you need to upgrade, they are incorrect. That is why I had to submit a second ticket. Don't let them talk you into an upgrade.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-on-webhost4life/#60" title="2008-10-14 04:54:30">Jacky</a>:</strong> Webhost4life is definately the best hosting company i use so far. Their price is cheap and their support is awesome. Webhost4life ROCKS! Keep up the good work guys =) I am referring customers to you for sure.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-on-webhost4life/#61" title="2008-10-18 21:53:36">Jordan</a>:</strong> I've been with webhost4life for several years, those guys make me impressive and life easily. I always introduce my friends and my colleagues to host with them; This is my blogs "2trees.cn"; if you want to host your website with them, you may refer to the url:www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=memberid to review their website. you can get a live chat with the guys.Hehe Jordan L.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/monorail-on-webhost4life/#62" title="2008-10-29 18:02:30">Ryan</a>:</strong> I too have something to say about this company. Hope this is helpful. WebHost4Life is clearly the best Windows based Web host service I know of. But to say this actually surprised myself, because I have been trying to find a “better” host company and moved away from WebHost4Life in the past year and half. I looked for alternative providers not because of any bad service I see, but because the bad ratings I see from online forums abut Webhost4Life. Now after trying 4 other Windows hosting providers, I can confidently say that WebHost4Life stands out among competitions and I will be a happy customer for a long time to come. WebHost4Life has many advantages over the competitions, and what I specifically like is the flexibility they provide for the site mangers. For example, their Control Panel web site is more user-friendly and much faster than those of other providers I tried. (most other providers use Plesk what I just hate! Too slow!!) For SQL Server hosting, the Control Panel allows site mangers to backup and restore SQL Server databases in a DIY-way without having to submitting a support ticket. This is very convenient. Plus, their online support has always been prompt and helpful. I highly recommend WebHost4Life. The site I host with WebHost4life is Karooba.com. We have high hope for this site (we hope it is the next big thing to come) and have worked hard to find the best web hosting provider. I can confidently say that WebHost4Life is the one!</p>

<p>I've heard or read too many git blog posts/pod casts state that if you create a new file in your local Git repo and you want to shorten the steps on getting it added to the local repository, all you have to do is:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">git commit -am "my commit message"
</pre>


<p>This is <em>not</em> true. If the file has never been added to the repo prior, then you still have to:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">git add &lt;file_name&gt;
</pre>


<p>Why?</p>
<p>The "git commit -a" command is a shortcut to a two-step process. After you modify a file that is already known by the repo, you still have to tell the repo, "Hey! I want to add this to the staged files and eventually commit it to you." That is done by issuing the "git add" command. "git commit -a" is staging the file and committing it in one step.</p>
<p>If you create a new file, edit it, and issue the "git commit -a" command, you will see something like:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">~ &gt; mkdir test
~ &gt; cd test
~/test &gt; git initInitialized empty Git repository in /Users/jasonmeridth/test/.git/
~/test(master) &gt; touch test
~/test(master) &gt; git commit -am "initial commit"
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       test
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>


<p>The "nothing added to commit but untracked files present" is the key comment. Git even suggests using "git add" to track the file. See, it's user friendly. Just be aware.</p>

<p>I've personally added a pre-commit hook to my local git repos. It's like a personal CI before I push back to origin/master. I run my tests locally anyway before committing and pushing, so I thought I would automate it.</p>
<p>I open the .git/hooks/pre-commit file in my local repo (i.e, full path is something like /Users/jasonmeridth/code/rails/myapp/.git/hooks/pre-commit) and put the following:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare
rake
</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>

<p>For non-rails developers, this will run any database migrations on my _development database, then ensure the _test database has the same schema, and then runs the tests.</p>
<p>Git hooks are not made executable by default, except on Windows because it doesn't understand the unix permissions. On my Mac, I have to issue the following command (from the app root):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
</pre>


<p>This makes the pre-commit hook executable and Git will run it before every commit to this repo. If this process returns a non-zero value (failure), then the commit does <em>not</em> happen. I'll be shown the failing tests and I can fix them and try to re-commit.</p>

                <div>
<p>Using the following code:</p>
<p>This git post-receive hook script queries the latest commit, gets the revision changes, and then passes that payload (via json) to a net/https POST call. I setup our <a href="http://www.integrityapp.com/">Integrity CI server</a> with a self-signed certificate and HTTP basic authentication.  </p>
<p>The Net::HTTP::Post.new instantiation group handles populating the basic authentication information and putting the payload into the form data of the request. The Net::HTTP.new group handles telling the request that it will be via SSL (443) and to not verify the SSL certificate (since I'm using a self-signed certificate; otherwise, I'd get a warning and kill my automation process)  </p>
<p>The other important part is the "if pid = fork". The ruby <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Process.html#M003179">fork</a> command allows code to happen in the background, in the case the POST call, and therefore make the call synchronous. Otherwise, when the developers commit their code to the repository, they will have to wait for the build to finish before their prompt will be returned to them. fork will return zero (0) if it fails to create the background process.  </p>
<p>I'm still checking whether the zombie process warning in the rdoc (for the fork command) is a problem. I'll update this if it is.  </p>
<p>The last line is notification for the user so they know what's going on. Always good to keep the user in the loop. :)</p>

<h3>ROUGH DRAFT - NOT READY FOR RELEASE OR REVIEW</h3>
<p>This post is on TortoiseGit.  For those that may be unaware, there is a very popular tool called TortoiseSVN that integrates with the Windows Explorer and allows a Windows User to graphically manage a Subversion repository.  Well, some developers decided to port that tool over to TortoiseGit.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_63A7C954.png"></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>I personally think that it’s funny that Google Code seems to be the place this code is hosted.  Why?  Google Code only supports Subversion and Mercurial, currently.  I would assume a tool that is used for Git repository management would be stored in a Git repository.  Maybe it’s just me.  That’s why when I go to the “Source” tab on the interface above, I see that the TortoiseGit code is actually hosted at <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/TortoiseGit.git">http://repo.or.cz/w/TortoiseGit.git</a>.  When I click the link you will see a gitweb interface to the repository.  <a href="http://repo.or.cz">http://repo.or.cz</a> is a public Git hosting website, kind of like http://<a href="http://github.com">github.com</a>.</p>
<p>I click on the “Downloads” tab and choose the the latest MSI file for your platform (32-bit or 64-bit).  If you don’t know, just choose the 32-bit.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_2E342891.png"> </p>
<p>The download begins.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_61927C9E.png"></p>
<p>I double-click the MSI and go through the wizard.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_62F93021.png"></p>
<p>I “Accept” the terms.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_0D6A82A1.png"></p>
<p>I make sure to choose OpenSSH for your SSH Client.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_7909DE77.png"></p>
<p>I choose where to install the application.  C:Program FilesTortoiseGit is the default.  I’m good with that.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_33876EFD.png"></p>
<p>“Ready to Install”</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_7041883E.png"></p>
<p>The install begins.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_7F7A81BC.png"></p>
<p>I click “Finish”.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_670CFF10.png"></p>
<p>I’m done.  Oh wait.  The next screen helps me remember why I love Windows.  A reboot is necessary so that TortoiseGit can integrate with the Windows Explorer.<img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_5CDDF554.png"></p>
<p>Click Yes.  Be right back.</p>
<p><em>Jeopardy Music Midi</em>  (j/k)</p>
<p>Okay, I’m back. I open Windows Explorer by clicking Windows+E on my keyboard.  I go to my code folder, C:code and notice that all my Git repository folders now have a green checkmark on them.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_507262DC.png"></p>
<p>I right-click the console_app, the repository we’ve been using in the past two posts.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_2457F69C.png"></p>
<p>and then on the “TortoiseGit” sub-menu:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_47AA0CA3.png"></p>
<p>Wow.  That is a lot of options.  We’re going to walk the list one by one.  I want to start with the “Settings” choice first:</p>
<p>SETTINGS</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_01BDFAE5.png"></p>

<h2><strong>THE .GIT FOLDER</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: The SHA1s and tags in this post are unique to my system.  The examples with SHA1s will not work on your system if you try the commands verbatim.  The commands that use tags will work if you name your tags the same.</p>
<p>When you run “<strong>git init</strong>” in a directory locally or “<strong>git clone…</strong>” to bring an existing git repository down locally, that folder would now have a subdirectory called .git.  This folder is the “soul” of git.  If I run “ls –al” on my /c/code/console_app/.git folder I see the following folder structure:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_2682C9AF.png"></p>
<p>Notice the “(GIT_DIR!)” text to the right on my console prompt.  Msysgit is helping me by reminding me what folder I’m in. Also notice that I have a bunch of files and five folders (hooks, info, logs, objects and refs).  I’m going to explain each directory then each file.</p>
<h3><strong>hooks</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_04D835B5.png"></p>
<p>Consists of files that you can populate with scripts that will execute during certain times in the Git event model.  These files are simply samples of what event hooks are available (hence the file extension of .sample).  I’ve created post-receive hooks for continuous integration (CI) events in the past.  <a href="blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2009/03/24/adding-a-git-post-receive-hook-to-fire-off-hudson-ci-server.aspx">Here</a> is a previous post I wrote on setting up a post-receive hook to work with a Hudson CI server that has a self-signed certificate and uses HTTP basic authentication.</p>
<h3><strong>info</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_0878E143.png"></p>
<p>Consists of an exclude file that is the same as the .gitignore file but is not including in the repository itself and therefore is not versioned.</p>
<h3><strong>logs</strong></h3>
<p>Consists of a file, HEAD, and a subdirectory, refs, which has the history of the interactions with branches, both local and remote.  The local branches (.git/logs/refs/heads/…) show commands like “<strong>git commit”</strong>, “<strong>git rebase</strong>”, “<strong>git reset</strong>”, etc.  The remote branches (.git/logs/refs/remotes/…) are usually “<strong>git fetch</strong>”, “<strong>git pull</strong>” or “<strong>git push</strong>”</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_5541C93B.png"></p>
<p>When I run “cat HEAD” I see all the commits I’ve issued from both my local master and local user_prompt branch. </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_39584656.png"></p>
<h4><strong>GIT REFLOG</strong></h4>
<p>This file seems to just be a list of commits that I’ve made on all the branches I’ve used (even on the user_prompt branch which does not exist any longer).  A better way to view this is via the “<strong>git reflog</strong>” command:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_56F46419.png"></p>
<p>This command “is a mechanism to record when the tip of branches are updated.  This command is to manage the information recorded in it”. (<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reflog.html">git-reflog</a>)  Any action I perform inside Git, when data is committed to the local repository, it is logged here to the reflog, aka the .git/logs/HEAD file.  I have heard of Git users being able to recover commits after they reset the HEAD back a few commits.  I have not personally tried this.</p>
<h3><strong>objects</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_1ED807A5.png"></p>
<p>Consists of all your objects (duh!).  What are the objects?  That’s a little ambiguous.  It looks like a bunch of two character alpha-numeric folders, plus info and pack folders.  In Git, objects are blobs, trees, commits, and tags.  What are the two characters?  They are the first two characters of an objects SHA1.  Then the files in those folders are named with the remaining 38 characters. (i.e., 9a438f1e971835a3ad724eb408a68fae45d7470a would translate to .git/objects/9a/438f1e971835a3ad724eb408a68fae45d7470a)</p>
<h4><strong>BLOB</strong></h4>
<p>A blob is generally a file. <br>
<img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_77341C2B.png"> <br>
(<a href="http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-blob.png">http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-blob.png</a>)</p>
<p>Consists of the binary content that is stored in the blob.  No filename.  Really?  Yep.  Git does not track files, it tracks content.  So if you have two files with the same content but different names (shame on you for violating “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</a>”) they will most likely point at the same blob object.  “The object is totally independent of its location in the directory tree…”.  This is usually handled by tree objects.  “…and renaming a file does not change the object that the file is associated with” (<a href="http://book.git-scm.com/1_the_git_object_model.html">http://book.git-scm.com/1_the_git_object_model.html</a>)</p>
<p>When I issue the “<strong>git show 0e0fdc6</strong>” command:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_71E7C62B.png"></p>
<p>where 0e0fdc6 is the SHA1 of the solution file on my initial commit, I see the files contents.  “<strong>git show</strong>” is a way to view information about Git objects (blobs, commits, trees, tags).</p>
<p><strong>TREE</strong></p>
<p>A tree usually represents a directory or sub-directory, containing a list of other trees and blobs. </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_7A018331.png"> <br>
(<a href="http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-tree.png">http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-tree.png</a>)</p>
<p>Consists of the type, SHA1 and filename of blobs and sub-trees.  When I run the “<strong>git ls-tree 97107ec</strong>“ command:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_0BE0A7B0.png"></p>
<p>with 97107ec being the SHA1 of the tree that my initial commit points to (shown in commit section below).   If I issue a “<strong>git show 97107ec</strong>” on this tree SHA1:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_16345CC1.png"></p>
<p>I see the names of the contents, but not the types or SHA1s. </p>
<h4><strong>COMMIT</strong></h4>
<p>A commit is a pointer to the SHA1 of a tree. </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_155E8788.png"> <br>
(<a href="http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-commit.png">http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-commit.png</a>)</p>
<p>Consists of the SHA1 of the tree it’s pointing at, the SHA1 of the parent commit, if not the initial commit, and the names of the author and committer.  Huh?  There’s a difference between the author and the committer.  Imagine you write a patch for an open source project.  When you tell the owner of the project to pull from your repository, you are the author, but they would the person committing it to the primary repository, the committer.  If I issue the “<strong>git show –s --pretty=raw 1731c38</strong>“ command, where 1731c38 is the SHA1 of my “initial commit” commit:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_201E6F8E.png"></p>
<p>I see the tree SHA1 that the commit points to, the author and the committer, who happen to both be me. If I just issue a regular “<strong>git show 1731c83</strong>”:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_3CBD7C12.png"></p>
<p>I actually see the diffs for all changes in the commit.  Since this was the initial commit SHA1, I see lots of plus signs (+) in the diffs.</p>
<h4><strong>TAG</strong></h4>
<p>A tag is a pointer to the SHA1 of a Git object.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_370783CE.png"> <br>
(<a href="http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-tag.png">http://book.git-scm.com/assets/images/figure/object-tag.png</a>) </p>
<p>Consists of an object SHA1, the type of object the SHA1 represents and the name of the person who issued the tag, the tagger.  I issue the “<strong>git tag v0.1 –m ‘v0.1’</strong>” command:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_14464C11.png"></p>
<p>This creates the tag object in the .git/objects/ folder.  If I run the “<strong>git cat-file tag v0.1</strong>” command:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_78381DD6.png"></p>
<p>This shows me the three items that make up a tag, object SHA1, type, and tagger.  If I issue a regular “<strong>git show v0.1</strong>” against the new tag:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_401BC162.png"></p>
<p>I see the tag information and also the information for the git object it points to; a git commit in this case.</p>
<h3><strong>refs</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_4CABFF2F.png"></p>
<p>Consists of the master copy of all remote tracking branches (.git/refs/remotes), local branches (.git/refs/heads), tags (.git/refs/tags), and the stash (.git/refs/stash), when used.  Master copy?  What does that mean?  Well, when I issue “<strong>git checkout dev</strong>” and checkout the checkout the master copy of the local dev branch, I’m replacing my working directory with a copy of .git/refs/heads/dev.  If I then issue “<strong>git checkout master</strong>” I’m replacing my working directory with .git/refs/heads/master, or a master copy of the local master branch. </p>
<p>The .git/refs/heads/master file, in my case, points to the latest commit for the local master branch.  In this case it’s the 41509ff SHA1:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_52F5666E.png"></p>
<p>Since we are in sync with the remote origin/master branch, the .git/refs/remotes/origin/master file points to the same SHA1:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_12C1DDA5.png"></p>
<p>The .git/refs/tags/v0.1 file points to the 8690e95 SHA1:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_28AB4FF5.png"></p>
<p>which is a Git tag object (.git/objects/86/90e95…) that points to commit 41509ff as we saw above in the Git tag object section.  So what this means is that currently all my git refs point to the same commit, 41509ff, more or less.</p>
<p>There is another type of git ref, stash, that I will talk about in a future post, but just know for now that the stash is located at .git/refs/stash/.</p>
<h3><strong>COMMIT_EDITMSG</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_45B3FEBD.png"></p>
<p>Consists of the last commit message.  From other readings, this seems to not even be used by git and is simply hear for reference.</p>
<h3><strong>FETCH_HEAD</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_4C6998F1.png"></p>
<p>Consists of the SHA1s of branch/remote heads that were updated during the last “<strong>git fetch</strong>”.  The last fetch occurred automatically when I pulled changes from my local user_prompt branch into my local master branch.</p>
<h3><strong>HEAD</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_228924BC.png"></p>
<p>Consists of the current reference that you are set to (usually a branch).  Normally master (aka .git/refs/heads/master).  I’m currently set to my local master branch.</p>
<h3><strong>ORIG_HEAD</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_3468493A.png"></p>
<p>Consists of the SHA1 of the branch I did the last “<strong>git merge</strong>” <em>into</em>.  In this case it’s the SHA1 of my local master branch before I pulled in the changes of my local user_prompt branch.</p>
<h3><strong>config</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_1F0D2483.png"></p>
<p>Consists of the settings for this repository.  I personally rarely edit this file and use the “git config<strong> …</strong>” command with options.  Read <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html">here</a> for all the possible settings.  I highly recommend the “git config color.*” commands to set color for your git commands and results.</p>
<h3><strong>description</strong></h3>
<p>Consists of a description that will usually be displayed if I were hosting this repository on <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Gitweb">gitweb</a> or with git instaweb.</p>
<h3><strong>index</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_12A1920B.png"></p>
<p>This is the “staging area” I’ve talked about in the past two posts.  This is the area you prepare so that you can make one commit to your local repository.  It consists of meta-data such as filenames, timestamps, and SHA1s.  <strong>DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h3>
<p>That is a rough introduction to the .git folder.  I mainly only ever interact with the config file and the hooks folder.</p>
<p>The two biggest concepts to take from this are the objects and refs.  Objects are blobs, commits, trees, and tags.  Refs are branches, remotes, tags, and the stash queue.  Once you completely understand that, interacting with Git will most likely become easier.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-3/#444" title="2009-06-08 15:59:54">Granville Barnett</a>:</strong> Tortoise Git is very good, has come on leaps and bounds in the last few months but git is best used via the terminal in my opinion. I'm not really a fan of the port to Windows, but its one that has been done well. The git mailing list is a rich source of information also.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-3/#445" title="2009-06-08 16:10:48">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Granville I'm a Linux user by heart, but just coded .NET for a living for years. We are in complete agreement on terminal vs. GUI. It is my evil plan to convert as many mouse-dependent users back to the keyboard full-time. I agree. After writing these entries, I've not had a single issue with Msysgit. I've read many of the threads on the git mailing list. You are correct, excellent information to be found in there.</p>

<p><em><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: I no longer use the “git pull –squash…” workflow.  I have a Part 4 post pending.  Please read the first part of this post for Github.com knowledge, but just skim the remainder.  Thanks.</em></p>
<p>Please make sure you’ve read the <a href="blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2009/06/01/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1.aspx">first post</a> and have created your SSH private and public keys.  You should also have a very basic understanding of the git init, add, commit, and log commands.  We will dive deeper on each of those.  We also visit git checkout, pull (—squash), push, remote, diff, log, mv.  I’ve done my best at making each git command that is mentioned in text to be of bold weight.  Each image, if a command is involved, has that command in big text before it.</p>
<p>This post is going to go over my typical workflow for work.  I’ll get as detailed as I can for this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>git pull origin master </li>
<li>git checkout –b user_prompt </li>
<li><code></code></li>
<li>git add <filename> (as necessary) </filename>
</li>
<li>git commit –a –m “commit message” </li>
<li>repeat step 3-5 as many times as necessary </li>
<li>git checkout master </li>
<li>git pull –-squash . user_prompt </li>
<li>git commit –a –m “add name validation and tests” </li>
<li>git pull origin master </li>
<li>git push origin master </li>
</ol>
<p>For this example, we’re going to create a <strong>remote</strong> public git repository on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github.com</a>.  What is <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a>?  <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> is the most popular Git repository hosting website on the Internets (misspelled on purpose) today, in my opinion.</p>
<p>First, I’m going to create my <a href="http://github.com">github.com</a> account.  I go to <a href="http://www.github.com">http://www.github.com</a> and click the “Pricing and Setup” link:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_314FAC3D.png"></p>
<p>Next, I click the “Signup” link next to the “Free!” account (Once you get comfortable, upgrading is easy):</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_129B5303.png"></p>
<p>Now I need to copy my public ssh key (id_rsa.pub) that I created from the first post into the Windows clipboard, so I can paste it to the web UI on this next step.  That means opening Notepad (Windows, type notepad and choose it from the results [Vista/Windows 7] or Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Notepad [2000/XP</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#492" title="2011-04-25 22:21:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Terry: I use "git rebase -i" to squash my commits from my local feature branch to my local master branch, and then push. a) I need to :) b) it isn't "invalid", it is just the one I was using at the time. :) I do squash Thank you, glad this series helped.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#425" title="2009-06-04 06:57:30">gitnoob</a>:</strong> I'll eagerly wait for the tortoisegit and extensions post, because honestly I can't find myself ever wanting to all this manual and overcomplicated work, remembering a million commands and arguments.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#426" title="2009-06-04 07:54:39">Erik</a>:</strong> Great post. You should really consider compiling this series to a small eBook PDF when you're done.. Cheers and thanks for the great writing.. Erik</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#427" title="2009-06-04 13:52:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @gitnoob Understandable. If anything, it will give you a greater respect for tortoisegit and the work it's doing in the background. :)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#428" title="2009-06-04 13:52:15">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Erik Not a bad idea. It all depends on how many posts I do. Thank you for the compliment.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#429" title="2009-06-04 14:54:25">mo</a>:</strong> This is an awesome series, Jason! I'm glad that you're doing it all from the shell. I find it more interesting then using gui's. Keep up the great work. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#430" title="2009-06-04 15:06:49">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @mo Thanks bro. I'm starting with the command line because it's what I know. I've been trying out tortoisegit the last month or so and I'll blog about that soon too.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#431" title="2009-06-04 16:16:39">Matt D.</a>:</strong> Amazing work, bro.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#432" title="2009-06-05 04:59:22">Gabriel N. Schenker</a>:</strong> awesome work Jason. I start to love git! Maybe you should note that on the very first try to connect to github with: $ git push origin master the follwing warning shows up: The authenticity of host 'github.com (65.74.177.129)' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? and if I just enter yes then I have the following confirmation Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,65.74.177.129' (RSA) to the list of known hosts. and only then will the command be executed...</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#433" title="2009-06-05 06:56:28">Jasdeep Singh</a>:</strong> Great job Jason. GIT really shines as a distributed version control system.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#434" title="2009-06-05 13:00:42">Niss E. Far</a>:</strong> I agree with the poster about complexity. It's 2009. Using a command-line tool for source control is just too 1980's on Windows. This is, I'm sorry to say, just lame. Tortoise does git now by the way, so hopefully, these ugly CLI utils should soon be a thing of the past.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#435" title="2009-06-05 13:50:30">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Matt D Thanks. @Gabriel I'm updating the post now @Jasdeep Thanks @Niss E. Far I understand that point of view. Calling my post lame because it doesn't suit the demographic though.....I don't understand. If you'd read my post and the comments from the last post, then you'd know that I'm fully aware that tortoisegit exists and plan to do a post on it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#436" title="2009-06-13 03:44:48">Donn</a>:</strong> Thanks for these posts Jason, they helped me walk through the steps I needed to pull an open source project and contribute. Much appreciated. Super good info. Thanks again.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#437" title="2009-07-08 18:02:52">Dan DeLeo</a>:</strong> This is pretty cool. Not a windows guy myself, but it's great to get git out as far and wide as possible, considering how awesome it is. A quick note: I haven't tried it, but it apparently is possible to use github with SSH only and run it on port 443, even through proxies. One Jeff Tchang wrote a guide on his blog: http://returnbooleantrue.blogspot.com/2009/06/using-github-through-draconian-proxies.html So users with paranoid network/firewall admins can use github with some extra work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#438" title="2009-07-08 18:09:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Donn np, glad it helped @Dan Thank you for the info. Those pesky Firewall admins...:)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#439" title="2009-07-09 09:56:08">Stefan Näwe</a>:</strong> In section "git remotes" the side note says: "git@github.com/armmer/console_app.git doesn’t look like a HTTP URL or a ssh:// protocol. What protocol is that? Um….it’s the git protocol. :) It’s optimized for this purpose. Information here. The note to take away is that it uses port 9418 by default, so if you have a paranoid firewall admin….no luck." That's not 100% correct. (BTW. There's a typo in the URL. It should read 'git@github.com:armmer/console_app.git' ) The URL "git@github.com..." does a connection using the SSH protocol and tunnels its own GIT protocol through it (i.e. it uses port 22 by default). Using the 'raw' GIT protocol (for cloning,pulling, fetching only) requires a URL like this: git://hostname/path/to/repo,git (More on the GIT URLs to be found in 'git help fetch') Good article(s) anyway. Regards, Stefan</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#440" title="2009-07-09 14:23:15">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Stefan That is awesome. Thank you for clarifying the GIT/SSH protocol relationships. I'm updating the post to reference your comment. Thanks for catching the typo also.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#441" title="2009-08-15 00:19:48">Adam D.</a>:</strong> git push and git pull will work with no params if you set it up correctly: git config remote.origin.url= git config remote.origin.fetch +refs/heads/<em>:refs/remotes/origin/</em> git config branch.master.remote origin git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master set up automatic tracking for any new branches you want to put up on the remote repo: git config --global push.default tracking</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#442" title="2009-08-24 20:34:10">Sam Bloomquist</a>:</strong> Thanks for a great set of tutorials. Git has been the back of my mind as something I need to learn for a while, and these few blog posts got me up to speed with the basics in a very short amount of time. Great work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#443" title="2009-08-24 20:48:48">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Sam Glad they helped</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#491" title="2011-04-25 21:15:00">Terry Aney</a>:</strong> "UPDATE: I no longer use the “git pull –squash…” workflow. I have a Part 4 post pending. Please read the first part of this post for Github.com knowledge, but just skim the remainder. Thanks." a) Is Part 4 still pending? b) Does this mean that your workflow just a bit below this update statement is invalid? I'm thinking I want to make a pattern for our environment that you always squash your commits on your local repo before they are put into our 'master repo' so this seemed to be what I was interested in. Great 3 part series...I'm late to the game but enjoyed them nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-2/#493" title="2011-04-26 15:21:00">Terry Aney</a>:</strong> For a git noob, mind expanding that a 'bit'. Just trying to get a policy in place of generally 'cleaning up local repo' before pushing. In my example I did... git checkout -b SquashTest edit... git commit -a -m "Squash Commit 1" edit.. git commit -a -m "Squash Commit 2" ...now what? I want to make these two commits one 'Squash Feature' commit. I tried git rebase -i, but it wants more options supplied...still getting over initial learning curve and if something on git-rebase man page was supposed to click, it didn't. Thanks in advance.</p>

I plan to convey everything I've learned the past 8 months while using git on a development team. I'm currently working on a Macbook Pro, doing Ruby on Rails development with git as the source control.  These posts will be specific to using git on the Windows operating system. This post is going to talk about installing msysgit, creating ssh keys, and creating a local git repository. If you already have msysgit installed, have created your ssh keys, and have an existing application you just want to put in a git repository, go here</p>
<h4>Installing msysgit On Windows</h4>
<p>For windows, install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list">msysgit</a> (both ssh key generation capabilities and git come with this tool): Download the latest version of msysgit: <img alt="" src="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/download11.png"> <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/download21.png"> Going through the setup.  Click next past the first window. <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install11.png"> Agree to the GPL terms: <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install21.png"> Set the installation location (default was fine for me: C:Program FilesGit): <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install31.png"> Choose installation options.  I don’t like to clutter my desktop, so that one is unchecked.  I also use Console2 so that is on my Quick Launch, not Git Bash  The context menu entries options give a user two new options on files when right-clicked in Windows Explorer.  We’ll talk about this later in the post. <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install41.png"> The next screen asks what name the folder that the program will be available from when I click Start-&gt;Programs, etc: <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install51.png"> I use the “Git Bash only” option because it’s the only reason I downloaded msysgit.  The other two options are tightly coupled to the operating system’s current setup. _ <strong>UPDATE</strong>:  Via <a href="http://joshuaflanagan.lostechies.com">Joshua Flanagan</a>, I was informed that tortoisegit, a UI tool, suggests that you choose the second option "Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt".  I've done both, I just prefer the first option because I don't use tortoisegit.  Just be aware._ <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install61.png"> Typical Windows developers won’t interact with other operating systems so choosing the 3rd option, in regards to non-handling of line-endings is usually best. <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install71.png"> Click next and the installation starts. <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install81.png"> Uncheck the readme (who reads those anyway?) and click Finish. <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/install91.png"> Once installed, when I click the Windows button and type git (since I’m using Windows 7) I’ll see “Git Bash”, “Git Gui'”, “Uninstall Git”.  Click “Git Bash”.  You will see the version at the top of the window.  We're good to go: <img alt="" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2009/06/done.png"> I also issue the following commands, “git config –global user.email <a href="mailto:my@email.com">my@email.com</a>” and “git config –global user.name ‘Jason Meridth’”: <img alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/image_thumb_3E2DDA4E.png"> After I commit code in my new repository, later in the post, we will see why these are relevant. </p>
<h4>Generating SSH Keys</h4>
<p>I’ve met a good number of Windows developers who don’t know what SSH is.  My quick definition of Secure Shell (aka SSH): A secure connection mechanism to other networked machines that support SSH, usually over port 22. It is pretty much the default form of remote communication for other platforms. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">More information if you're interested</a>. <em>History and Retrospective</em>: I used to use cygwin + ssh keys for my git stuff on my windows VMs, but have realized, via advice from a friend, that cygwin will not be the easiest thing to teach to a typical Windows user. I am in no way assuming that any of our readers are "typical" windows users, but he's right. And msysgit needs to become the defacto Windows git tool anyway. What better way to help that project succeed than to give it more users.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#410" title="2009-06-01 11:11:30">Erik</a>:</strong> For Windows OS, Git Extensions is a great UI addon for git, it also installs plugins for Visual studio 2005/8.. TurtouiseGit is nice as well. However I think the most important knowledge is what you wrote very well about, the basic bashing and understanding git.. Cheers, Erik</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#411" title="2009-06-01 13:35:03">Joshua Flanagan</a>:</strong> Thanks for all your git help Jason. Looking forward to the rest of the series! One thing to note, when installilng msysGit, you recommended the Git Bash Only setting for setting up your PATH. However, readers may want to be aware that the TortoiseGit installation (bottom of http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) recommends that you install msysGit with the middle option (run Git from Windows Command Prompt). Something to consider if you think you might install TortoiseGit later. (I haven't, yet) If you choose the middle option, you still get the git Bash shell - you dont HAVE to use the Windows Command prompt, as the dialog may imply.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#412" title="2009-06-01 14:29:08">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Erik I'd heard about the Git Extensions stuff, but was going to try it out this week. Thanks for the heads-up. I'm going to focus more on the commands, then the tools in this series. @Joshua I haven't installed tortoisegit in a while and didn't remember that they suggested that setting on msysGit. I'll update the post accordingly. Thanks for watching out.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#413" title="2009-06-01 17:22:30">derick.bailey</a>:</strong> are you going to do "GIT for SVN User" in this series? I'm still learning the ways of GIT, and my SVN experience gets in my way a lot. If you aren't going to do that, though, maybe I will. :)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#414" title="2009-06-01 17:34:21">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Derick I can. It's an easy change to this post and I can add it to future posts.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#415" title="2009-06-01 21:36:55">Integrum</a>:</strong> Great step by step guide for those doing development in Windows world.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#416" title="2009-06-02 06:02:23">Gabriel N. Schenker</a>:</strong> finally I get onto the Git train too! Have to refresh my Unix skills they are a little bit rusty. thanks Jason</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#417" title="2009-06-11 19:14:00">Ramit Prasad</a>:</strong> I don't know about Windows 7, but in Windows XP, you could type "edit .file" and exit and the file would be created. If you have some *nix tools, then you can type "touch .file" Only the Windows GUI balks at files that start with periods. Otherwise I don't have any problems opening or dealing with them once they are created. Great tutorial though. Thanks!</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#418" title="2009-06-20 02:15:14">mjlefevre</a>:</strong> This GIT thing still feels "forced" on Windows. Think I'll let it mature a little. Good article though.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#419" title="2009-08-06 20:52:36">Jim</a>:</strong> Any advice on how to get git bash working with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/">console2</a>? Thanks in advance, Jim</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#420" title="2009-08-06 21:23:22">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Jim I don't use that tool, but I imagine if you install msysgit and add the git bin folder to your PATH, you should be able to use git from that console tool just fine. That is just a guess.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#421" title="2009-08-15 00:11:02">Adam D.</a>:</strong> I would leave autocrlf to false in your set up UNLESS you ARE planning to do cross-platform dev. It's not worth the potential problems.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#422" title="2009-08-23 16:19:07">Matthew</a>:</strong> Nice article. BTW, what color scheme are you using for your Visual Studio? I like the colors! Mind to share?</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#423" title="2009-08-23 16:49:25">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Adam D. That is an excellent point. I will update the post Thank you @Matthew Of Course. That is compliments of my fellow LosTechies blogger, Sean Biefeld, http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/seanbiefeld/archive/2009/03/22/my-visual-studio-twilight-theme.aspx (download link at the bottom of the post)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#424" title="2009-08-24 06:20:40">Matthew</a>:</strong> @Jason That's fantastic! Thanks again!</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#497" title="2011-05-20 09:52:00">Stephen Dryden</a>:</strong> Great article thanks - a much better introduction than the ProGit book</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#498" title="2011-05-20 21:21:00">Tevfik Sertel</a>:</strong> Unfortunately I had to learn working with git on a windows machine until my *nix machine is ready so this was a really helpful article. Thanks for the info.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#499" title="2011-05-20 21:24:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @stephen_dryden:disqus @google-24db0cf339bb97edd224c7b5d6b1c69f:disqus  Glad the articles helped. I'm redoing the 3rd and 4th ones soon.  And adding a 5th to share some learned lessons.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#500" title="2011-05-23 14:48:00">Michael Delamaza</a>:</strong> Incredible post.  Immensely useful.  Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#501" title="2011-05-23 15:30:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> You're welcome.  Glad it helped.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#504" title="2011-06-12 18:57:00">Colasante Manuel</a>:</strong> You defintively saved me a lot of time here. thanks a lot, clear and concise. 10/10 !</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#507" title="2011-08-12 12:57:00">Martyn</a>:</strong> Still the best tutorial that I could find. Thanks! Martyn</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#508" title="2011-10-07 03:22:00">Manfei</a>:</strong> when i use the command "git status" ,the consol showed "bad config value for 'color.ui' in c:/Users/Administrator/.gitconfig".why?</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#509" title="2011-10-07 04:29:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> type "git config -l" or "cat /c/Users/Administrator/.gitconfig" in Git Bash.  What value do you have for color.ui?  Normally it just says true or false. To set it properly: git config color.ui true</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#510" title="2011-10-08 09:36:00">Manfei</a>:</strong> Thanks</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#511" title="2011-10-24 06:50:00">Denis Solovyov</a>:</strong> Windows doesn’t understand dot files (i.e., .bashrc, .gitignore, etc).  Windows expects your files to have a name.extension convention. use a notepad for that:D</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#512" title="2011-10-24 12:56:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> I understand that.  I was saying you can't create a dotfile from Windows Explorer. I usually edit them in Git Bash (inside Console2)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#514" title="2011-11-08 03:52:00">Abstraktron</a>:</strong> Thanks very helpful!</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#518" title="2011-11-30 20:33:00">Adam</a>:</strong> Great tutorial.. thanks for taking the time to write it up!</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#524" title="2012-03-09 07:16:00">sb22</a>:</strong> to create a dot file in Windows, put a dot at the end too. For example to create .htaccess in explorer, rename to .htaccess.  windows will drop the dot at the end since the extension is nothing command prompt rename works as expected, rename to .htaccess Works in Vista and Win 7.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#525" title="2012-03-09 07:19:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> I did not know that.  Nice trick.  Thank you for sharing.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#526" title="2012-03-14 18:17:00">Cherif</a>:</strong> Great tuto! Thanks a lot!</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/git-for-windows-developers-git-series-part-1/#527" title="2012-03-29 20:33:00">Mark Webb</a>:</strong> Your the Man Jason! Been a bit confused jumping from local unix and MS machines. Your tutorial was excellent! By the way, "trying to not let best be the enemy of the better" is a refrain that soothes my OCD. Thanks again, looking forward to more of your work!</p>

<p>This is my first blog post from TextMate on my Mac. I'm using the HTML formatting. I will try the markdown and textile versions later. The key to getting this working with Community Server was when you click "Bundles-&gt;Blogging-&gt;Setup Blogs" and the following template shows up:</p>
<h2>List of Blogs</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Enter a blog name followed by the endpoint URL</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Blog Name URL</h2>
<p>you put the following underneath the commented header</p>
<p>My Blog Name http://username@www.mydomain.com/blogs/<api_key>/metablog.ashx#<api_key></api_key></api_key></p>
<p>The key part is #<api_key>. api_key in Community Server terms is the portion of your url after domain/blogs/ and before the page requested. Mine is jason_meridth. My full URL for TextMate blogging would be http://myusername_notsharing@www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/metablog.ashx#jason_meridth.</api_key></p>
<p>Hope this may help a fellow Mac brethren</p>

<p>EXPLAINING EACH LINE: I avoid writing bash scripts in default bash if I can. This is for a Ruby on Rails app, so I decided to write it in Ruby. </p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr>
<td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td>
<td class="code">
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<p>The while loop checks to make sure there are values in STDIN (by default they are rev_old, rev_new, and ref).</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">#   
while (input = STDIN.read) != ''
end
</pre>


<p>I put an if statement block:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">if ref == "refs/heads/master"
end
</pre>


<p>to make sure I only fire the build if it is the master branch. Set the URL for the app you want to build:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">url="http://yourhudsondomain.com/job/job_name_here/build?delay=0sec"
</pre>


<p>Add a little text to notify the user what is going on (always a good idea):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">puts "Run Hudson build for job_name_here application"
</pre>


<p>And finally all the url with wget and feeding any response to <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/06/06/what-does-devnull-21-mean/">the black hole that is /dev/null</a></p>
<p>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">`wget #{url} &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1`
</pre>


<p>IMPORTANT: Don't forget to run:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">chmod a+x .git/hooks/post-receive
</pre>


<p>so that the file can be run Some Gotchas: 1. If you are going to a url that has http basic authentication like my actual script does, you can pass the username and password like you normally would in an HTTP call:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">url="http://username:password@yourhudsondomain.com/job/job_name_here/build?delay=0sec"
</pre>


<p>2. If you are doing an https call with a self-signed certificate, wget will complain. You can add the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/HTTPS-_0028SSL_002fTLS_0029-Options.html">--no-check-certificate</a> argument to wget to bypass certificate validation against local certificate caches:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">`wget --no-check-certificate #{url} &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1`
</pre>

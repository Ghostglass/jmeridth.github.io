    <div><p>I'm not a very theoretical guy.  I don't like to discuss things to no solution.  When presented with a new idea, I like to see the code, tool, or mechanism that helps put that theory/idea into action.  I'm fine tuning (still working very hard at) my people skills.  I know that in order for software to succeed it's the communication that matters.  I can usually make people think about what they want and they usually know they need to be prepared when they approach me, because I don't like to waste time.  I like the occasional "check my email" or "watch that YouTube video"; so don't get me wrong.</p>
<p>One of the <strong>best</strong> lessons I got from my weekend in Austin during the ALT.net conference was the following line from the Agile Manifesto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Individuals and interaction over processes and tools."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first interaction with Agile was in 2003 and it was a bad one.  After that I got onto a team with a manager that was trying to make the transition from Corporate Waterfall to some form of Agile/Extreme Programming.  Another team on campus was actually already practicing Extreme Programming (the team I'm currently on) and we tried to interact with them as much as possible.  A co-worker and I went to design patterns sessions with the other group and also tried to have daily stand-ups on our own team.  We had a very frustrating build process and it was slightly automated but still required a great deal of manual interaction and knowledge.  Unfortunately, I started getting pinned down as our "build guy".  I asked one of the guys on the other team what they were using and that's when I starting using NAnt and CC.net.  From this experience, I completely understand <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/ian_cooper/archive/2007/11/19/which-practices-to-implement-first.aspx">Ian's recent experience and choice with going after the build first.</a> </p>
<p>The reason I bring this up is because I had a good discussion with some colleague's about what to do first when trying to get a team to go to agile.  My immediate response was to attach a weak point, which is usually the build process.  A continuous integration server using NAnt can usually take care of that pain.  It took 2+ hours for my colleagues to make me realize that I was approaching the process in the wrong manner.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how many tools or processes you put in place, if you haven't helped the team to learn to communicate or commence in knowledge sharing, they will do no good. </p>
<p>Another recent experience was with stories names at my current employer.  Unfortunately, some of our stories names have turned into 3-5 word phrases, therefore leading to some ambiguity about what the expected behavior is of the story.  I had been introduced to Dan North's "As a <x>, I want to <y>, So that I can <z>" a while ago.  After recently seeing some passion around stories I re-read about the format and decided to pitch to our Systems and Business Analysts.  I didn't take the time to access how big of a change/idea this really was going to be.  One of the suggested solutions I was given was to schedule time for training so that the Systems and Business teams have the ability to make inquiries and gain a better understanding of the change.  Common sense solution, but it again highlighted the idea of focusing on the people and not the process/tool.</z></y></x></p>
<p>What experience do you guys/gals have with tools vs. people?  Did you have a team respond to a tool/process that did help in your software creation?</p></div>

The [Austin .NET Users Group (ADNUG)](http://www.adnug.org/), which consists of a good number of the CodeBetter.com developers, is hosting thier FREE Code Camp again this year.  
An email was sent out to the ADNUG forum stating the dates and times would be posted sometime next week.  
  
Any .NET/Java/OOP developer in the South Texas region should think about going.  
  
I almost went last year but had a family obligation which prevented it.  
The code examples and a listing of who spoke last year are [here](http://www.adnug.org/codecamp2006/codecamp2006downloads.aspx).  
  
I will update this posting once the information is available.

I've decided to take the new [Coursera](http://coursera.org) [Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1](https://class.coursera.org/androidpart1-001) to see if it can give me more insight past the "Intro to Android" tutorials I've already done before.  There are subsequent classes after this one, so we'll see how it goes.  I plan to blog after each assignment to get my thoughts out and anything interesting I've learned.

Cloverfield sucked.

Don't waste your money.

Plot was weak.  You do get to see the "monster".

**[Jimmy Bogard](#213 "2008-01-18 20:15:04"):** Was the "monster" something deep and thought-provoking like: \- Our consumerist culture \- Mainstream media \- Global warming \- Corporate influence in government \- Racism \- Evils of Halloween - you just THINK it's about candy \- That big hairy beast hiding under my bed who wants to steal my kidneys \- Al Gore Now THAT would be cool.

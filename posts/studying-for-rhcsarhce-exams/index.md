I have decided to finally get the RHCSA and RHCE certifications.  RHCSA stands for Redhat Certified System Adminitrator and RHCE stands for Redhat Certified Engineer.  The reason I decided on these exams is for 2 reasons:

1. They are not multiple choice.  You sit at a kiosk with VNC and are given a live RHEL (Redhat Enterprise Linux) instance and are given issues to fix (aka Real World)
1. A stepping stone to me finally taking my Linux knowledge/skills seriously.

Please note, I've been using linux for 17 years.  I've managed multiple systems to hundreds of VMs.  I'll keep you posted on how it goes.

I think it is awesome when a company like TargetProcess, who makes the BEST agile management tool out there, creates a site to allow new users/companies to use a free alternative.Â  They do this because they know if you are truly serious about managing your project correctly, you'll purchase TargetProcess. (shameless plug)

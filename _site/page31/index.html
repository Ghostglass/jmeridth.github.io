      <p>For my recollection and anyone else who finds the need to list all projects for a build file:</p>

<p><strong>nant -projecthelp</strong></p>

<p>I keep forgetting this and want to centralize it for my knowledge.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#205" title="2007-11-07 15:27:47">Jimmy Bogard</a>:</strong> Also, it will separate your targets out to “Default Target”, “Main Targets”, and “Sub Targets”. “Default Target” is obvious of course, but the other two are broken out by the “description” attribute. If a target has a description, it goes in the “Main Targets” list, otherwise, it goes in the “Sub Targets” list. I used to document all my targets with “description”, but now I only do the “public” ones. XML comments are better suited for more detailed descriptions.</p>

      <h3 id="recap">RECAP</h3>

<p>I’ve been pretty busy as of late and even had some issues with the way I was trying to unit test validation.  As you can see <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joeydotnet/archive/2007/10/25/monorail-controller-test-analysis-problem-and-resolution.aspx">here</a>, I was able to get some help from <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joeydotnet">Joey</a> on this and it has made me realize that I need to re-write my MonoRail Validation post to use the “correct” manner of validation.  Even Oren agrees that the <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/21/The-IoC-mind-set-Validation.aspx">validation</a> library in MonoRail works, it is just not the ideal way of doing it.</p>

<h3 id="sending-an-email">SENDING AN EMAIL</h3>

<p>You have to do 3 things to send an email successfully:</p>

<p>1. Write your unit test showing your expectations of the code:</p>

      <p><strong><em>UPDATE: Be aware that SharpDevelop doesn’t seem to support the Web Application Project support.  It will handle ASP.NET Web Site Creation (Normal 2.0 web site project) but is doesn’t have the ability to handle the legacy (1.1-) way of site project layout.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>_UPDATE #2: Keyboard shortcuts can be found <a href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/KeyboardShortcuts.ashx">here</a>. The trunk can be found <a href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/AccessingTheRepository.ashx">here</a> for version 3.0. _</strong></p>

<p>I know Oren has <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/09/21/ReSharper-for-Boo.aspx">commented</a> on <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/">SharpDevelop</a> before because of it’s Boo support, but I decided to dive into it further today and I’m thoroughly amazed.  I’m not a <a href="http://boo.codehaus.org/">Boo</a> developer (not yet) so I can’t comment to that support yet.  I have used it in the past for <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/">WiX</a> project UI development, because I hate dealing with the XML files for the UI templates for WiX.</p>

<p>Here is a screen shot:</p>

<p><img src="jasonmeridth/files/2011/03SharpDevelop_10570/image_thumb_1.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>If you can tell:<br />
Left window is my “Solution Explorer”.  There is built-in Subversion support, hence the green checkmarks.  There is good syntax highlighting and intellisense in the main window. I currently have a build file open (XML Tree tab is an option on the bottom, it uses the nant.xsd and it is a more user friendly experience)  The top-right window is a NAnt helper.  It pulls up the targets of my build file and allows me to run it from the IDE.  Also, there is a built-in test runner (bottom-right) window.</p>

<p>What I have installed or am using in Visual Studio 2005/2008:<br />
<a href="http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/">Ankh</a> (Subversion)<br />
<a href="http://nantgui.berlios.de/">NAnt GUI</a> (NAnt GUI helper) - I only use this for presentations.  I’m a command line guy.<br />
JetBrains Test Runner [<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/unitrun/download/index.html">UnitRun</a>] (Comes with my ReSharper install, you used to be able to download it separately, but not anymore)<br />
<a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/votive.html">Votive</a> (For WiX projects)<br />
<a href="http://testdriven.net/">TestDriven.NET</a><br />
<a href="http://www.kiwidude.com/dotnet/DownloadPage.html">NCoverExplorer</a></p>

<p><img src="jasonmeridth/files/2011/03SharpDevelop_10570/image_thumb_2.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>This is ALL Built-into SharpDevelop.  I think you have to have NUnit and NCover in your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>My last selling point was that it has built-in keystrokes for ReSharper-esqe commands.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> you can do Ctrl+N or Ctrl+Shift+N to look for files or classes by name.  In SharpDevelop it is Ctrl+G.  In Visual Studio this goes to a specific line number, but in SharpDevelop it does ALL 3.</p>

<p><img src="jasonmeridth/files/2011/03SharpDevelop_10570/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Oh yeah, and guess what……It’s FREE and open source.  You need a new feature, contribute. :)</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p><strong><a href="#190" title="2007-11-01 23:41:32">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> I am downloading it as we speak. I played with it about a year ago but it didn’t have all of those features. I am installing on my vmware fusion xp drive on my macbook right now. Hopefully it runs a little better than VS does in vmware</p>

<p><strong><a href="#191" title="2007-11-02 00:37:26">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> I’m in the same boat sean. I tried it 2 years ago and it was not near what it is now. It loaded my project pretty fast. The only thing I’ve noticed is that it doesn’t have a built-in web server like Visual Studio (Cassini), so when I try to run my web project from the IDE it doesn’t work. The other positives outway the negatives so far. I’m very impressed.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#192" title="2007-11-02 00:42:55">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> I am very impressed as well. I have my web project setup through IIS so i dont think the cassini problem will be a problem for me, although it would be handy It is very quick AND lightweight. it runs a hell of alot faster than VS does, thats for sure. i’m going to install it on my work machine tommorrow and see how it runs. I suppose asking for R# integration is too much to ask? =)</p>

<p><strong><a href="#193" title="2007-11-02 00:52:36">cramsay</a>:</strong> I tried it a couple of days ago, it’s very fast. I like how it doesn’t force its own project format on you, meaning you could potentially use SD at home and VS at work. Version 3 will have built-in refactoring and support for additional refactorings as add-ins; if they pull that off I could see it being popular but until then I won’t switch because I’m so reliant on R#.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#194" title="2007-11-02 02:29:18">Tom Opgenorth</a>:</strong> #Develop has really come a long way in the past three years or so. I’ve notice that it doesn’t seem to want to play nice with VS2005 solutions files though.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#195" title="2007-11-02 03:08:26">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> @Tom that was the problem I saw when I played with it a year ago, although today when I downloaded version 2.2 I opened a 2005 solution and everything seemed to work perfectly. Like I said earlier, the real task will be to open a couple of my larger projects at work and see how it reacts to those. The project I was testing it on in vmware was just a bare bones webapp that I dont have alot of code in atm</p>

<p><strong><a href="#196" title="2007-11-02 04:02:47">Joe Ocampo</a>:</strong> reaffirming that VS is notepad with ReSharper. LOL Nope, wait a minute it is has an awesome file management explorer. To bad I always use [Control-N] to Navigate it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#197" title="2007-11-02 04:03:50">Joe Ocampo</a>:</strong> Here is another question if Jet-Brains offered ReSharper for SharpDevelop would you switch?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#198" title="2007-11-02 08:45:25">cramsay</a>:</strong> Joe: I’d definitely look at it more seriously. At the moment I’m a bit, “well, it’s nice but no R#” so I haven’t given it much serious use. Even if it did have R# I might then come across something that was a dealbreaker when I started giving it serious use. That said, there are few things in an IDE with as much awesome-factor as R#, so I can’t wait to see what SD3 brings.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#199" title="2007-11-02 11:36:25">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Joe: YES! if Re# was a plugin for #Develop. I would switch. As a matter of fact, I switched last night. I’m going to grok #Develop.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#200" title="2007-11-02 12:25:05">jlockwood</a>:</strong> I tried using #Develop about 3 years ago and I felt I was better off trying to use Eclipse for C# development. It’s really looking nice now. I’ll need to try compiling it with mono and see how it fares on Linux…</p>

<p><strong><a href="#201" title="2007-11-02 17:05:37">Ben Scheirman</a>:</strong> I’m glad you posted this. I also tried it a while back and it wasn’t near ready. Can you post again on things that might not be so nice if you transition from VS 2005 to #D?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#202" title="2007-11-02 17:44:52">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Ben: Definitely. I’ve posted 2 updates to the top of the post already. I just downloaded the 3.0 trunk and installed and it is missing NAnt, and a few other common features, but that is to be expected from Alpha. :)</p>

<p><strong><a href="#203" title="2007-11-02 20:17:14">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> I installed at work today and played with it for a little while. It is really fast on my machine at work that is a little beefier than my macbook. One thing that I don’t like too much is the fonts and colors. In VS I have a fonts and colors .settings file that i’ve carried around for awhile that has alot of special key mappings and coloring that I can’t carry to #Develop. I wouldn’t say its a deal breaker but it would be nice. I loaded up a large project at work to test it. It loaded so fast that I was going to read an email waiting for it to load and before I could look away it had already loaded the solution. This is probably one of the strongest points for me if you can’t tell. Far too often VS hangs or stalls for a second or two. Nothing aggravates me more than when the cursor is supposed to be typing characters and instead it just sits there waiting for the IDE to play catch up. I had a problem with associating a .retl (rhino-etl) file with boo because it didnt have a .boo extension so I posted a question to the forum and had a response within a couple of minutes. The response didn’t fix the problem but it’s nice to see an active community around it. I’ll probably play more with it over the weekend and post some more findings.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#204" title="2007-11-08 14:24:59">J.P. Hamilton</a>:</strong> I installed it about a month ago, admittedly just for the Boo support. What a surprise! This is nothing like the SharpDevelop I remember from a few years back. It is very mature.</p>

      <p>I got excited about ThoughtWorks releasing <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/controlpanel/blogs/Saifuddin%20Goderya">Mingle 1.1</a>.  The software license states that it is free for the first 5 users.</p>

<p>I have used older version of ThoughtProcess and their new one looks sweet, but expensive.</p>

<p>Today however, I installed MySql (no worries) and then Mingle and as soon as the service started my server went to a hault.</p>

<p> This is what I saw when I opend the task manager:</p>

<p> <img src="/blogs/jason_meridth/mingle_performance.GIF" alt="ThoughtWorks Mingle" /></p>

<p>I looked at the processes and it was the Mingle service that did it.</p>

<p>This might have been a bad installation on my part, but I followed their instructions to the “T”.  I am still researching.</p>

<p>Anyone else seeing this kind of problem with Mingle?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#171" title="2007-11-01 20:07:37">schambers</a>:</strong> unfortunately I am seeing the same thing on my ubuntu server installation of mingle. it also eventually eats up all 1.5gb of memory. When I inquired on the thoughtworks forum awhile ago my thread asking about the cpu usage was deleted. I posted another thread asking about the memory and got the response, “Mingle requires 2gb of memory to run” I was taken back by this as i was the ONLY user in there at the time. Apparently it isn’t a fluke either, I saw alot of other threads on their forum stating the same results. I may get blasted for this, but this seems to be ruby stretched to its limit. I dont have enough experience with RoR to make this a firm statement though. I wish it was better than this because it is an awesome management application to use. I am thinking about going back to Acunote or RallyDev. I can’t afford putting up a whole server just to handle this one application. oh well</p>

<p><strong><a href="#172" title="2007-11-01 20:22:15">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Wow. 2GB for memory. You are correct Sean. http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle/1.1/help/Content/installing_mingle/system_requirements.htm Helps if I RTFM.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#173" title="2007-11-01 20:51:06">Steve Burman</a>:</strong> We have seen the memory issues here as well. We run Mingle (currently 1.0) on our main server which has 8GB of RAM. Admittedly it runs a few virtual machines but MingleServer.exe is constantly having its memory usage blow out. We are forced to periodically restart it because eventually even the most basic operations within Mingle take an intolerable amount of time to execute. We only tolerate it because Mingle is so damn nifty for project management.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#174" title="2007-11-01 22:26:10">Joe Ocampo</a>:</strong> Wow, has Microsoft affected us that bad that we think it is OK to have to reboot everyday!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#175" title="2007-11-01 23:23:28">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> I am running mingle on an ubuntu virtual server with a dedicated 1.5gb of memory. Like you state Steve, I am forced to perodically restart the MingleServer process every now and then. I reallly hope thoughtworks addresses these issues as I would really hate to stop using it because of something silly like system requirements. I think more than anything it really disturbed me that they deleted my thread where I was posting these issues for others to see. It wasn’t negative in any way, it just stated what I experienced with my resources so that they can document the problems and hopefully address the issues. I can understand not wanting negative press for a new product but this was back when it was still in beta so of course every knew there would be problems. I just came to the conclusion that they didn’t want my feedback so I don’t plan on providing anymore in the future.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#176" title="2007-11-02 10:58:28">Sergio Pereira</a>:</strong> Got the same problem on a mac with 2GB RAM during the beta period. It became unusable so I couldn’t even decide if I liked Mingle or not.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#177" title="2007-11-02 17:03:03">Ben Scheirman</a>:</strong> You could go into Hanselmode (TM) and pull out WinDbg.exe and see what system calls it’s spending its time in. That could be useful info for the Mingle team.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#178" title="2007-11-02 17:45:42">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Ben: Excellent suggestion. Don’t whine, present a possible solution to problem. Got it. :)</p>

<p><strong><a href="#179" title="2007-11-05 10:00:13">Adam Monago</a>:</strong> I have noticed that a number of folks on this thread had only tried a pre-release version of Mingle. I would encourage anyone who had evaluated during the early access release to give 1.1 a try and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. The CPU usage Jason mentions above is normal in the first few minutes after the installation as the system generates history and search indices for the existing templates that are shipped with the product. After a couple of minutes it actually goes down significantly. Memory usage is actually very stable with the 1.1 release, and although it does require a healthy amount of memory, that usage is quite consistent throughout. There is a correlation between the number of JRuby instances and memory usage. If you are comfortable experimenting with different memory configurations, there are some guidelines for tweaking the amount of memory allocated for Java, as well as the number of JRuby instances that can be created by Mingle in the config/web.xml file. Lastly, apologies to Sean if there has been any misunderstanding; I can see one post that he made to the forum for which there was a response. You’re welcome to come back and participate at any time.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#180" title="2007-11-06 12:52:27">Bil Simser</a>:</strong> I’m experience pain and suffering with Mingle. We started with v1 and updated to 1.1. Server is slow and pegged out, MySQL is falling down, website is horrendously slow once you get more than 20 stories in a project. In short, I consider Mingle a disaster and we’re looking for alternatives starting today. Planning on blogging my plight with details to come.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#181" title="2007-11-27 19:27:33">Arthur Tam</a>:</strong> I’m experiencing the same problem where within minutes of starting up Mingle half a gig of RAM will have already been used. I’m running Mingle on a virtual server with 1 GB RAM and it is really frustrating when Mingle eats up all the RAM and the virtual server starts to behave strangely. I ended up creating several cron jobs to restart the Mingle process during times it’s less likely to be used. It doesn’t solve my problem but it lowers the amount of times I need to manually restart my virtual server.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#182" title="2007-11-28 00:21:48">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> I will come back and kick this horse again =) I had an interesting conversation with an Apple engineer today at lunch about RoR and I brought up Mingle. I was mainly talking about how it was a really neat project management tool and had a super cool interface but it was a HUGE hog. We both agreed that interpeted languages will only go so far. Look at Twitter for instance. Once your traffic and/or application base gets to a certain size, where is your upgrade path? You have none. throw more memory at the problem. I think Mingle is an very good example of RoR pushed to the limits. Anyways I shouldn’t complain anymore. I have moved my mingle server to a dedicated box with 3gb of memory and it seems to perform much better.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#183" title="2007-12-11 00:50:02">Yan</a>:</strong> Mingle’s crappy performance has nothing to do with RoR. It does not take 2 cpus and a gig of ram to change the status on a bug. The product design is just so great but I can’t believe they actually let themselves get away with releasing a simple database app that requires 2 gig of ram. It’s EMBARASSING thoughtworks! Embarassing, nothing less! And to add insult to injury, they obfuscate the code with their java compiling so that the community can’t help fix these problems. Honestly I think mingle actually <em>gets it</em> in terms of story and bug tracking (contextual views with drag and drop), but releasing it with such nasty performance and then trying to charge money for it? Everyone please actively post to your blog about this - thoughtworks needs to be called out. Either fix it or release it as plain RoR so we can run it on mongrel. I’m willing to bet most of the performance issues are actually coming from the jruby and java container. No RoR app takes this long to start up!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#184" title="2007-12-11 15:39:24">Sidu</a>:</strong> Start up time has always been an issue when you have to fire up a new JVM, but there is something called NailGun which can help and which is now part of JRuby (if I’m not mistaken). Also, a base MRI/Rails/Mongrel instance (with no additional code) eats 60MB of memory anyway. A quick look at Mingle’s web.xml indicates that Mingle ships with with 8 JRuby runtimes/Rails instances, so it’s not surprising it hogs memory. The next release of Mingle will ship with JRuby 1.1 (the latest Mingle, 1.1, uses JRuby 1.0) which should definitely improve performance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#185" title="2008-02-22 14:54:32">Chris Hefley</a>:</strong> Just adding my voice to the outcry, hoping Thoughtworks will take notice. I absolutely love Mingle, and I want to use the hell out of it, but the performance issues are crippling. When I first start it up, it’s consuming about 81MB of RAM, no big deal, but after a few minutes of usage it gets up close to 500MB, and it never drops back down. I installed it on my Build Server, and now I have to reboot it regularly, primarily because of Mingle’s memory problems.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#186" title="2008-04-17 07:36:44">smortensen</a>:</strong> Yup. Mingle bites on memory and CPU. Even the full-blooded latest release just cranks your cpu and chews 500MB of ram. I’m the only guy trialling it on the virtual server and i’ve only a single project with bugg3r all action on it (ie only me!)… It’s a ruddy joke. 500MB, PLUS my DB, PLUS the webPortal. Get a grip people. Supersize my coke for free, sure, but leave my memory at standard would ya?</p>

<p><strong><a href="#187" title="2008-04-17 10:48:43">schambers</a>:</strong> After just reviewing the latest version myself it indeed seems like they STILL have performance problems. With myself using it and noone else, it takes a full 5 seconds to open most pages. This is on a box with 2 gb of memory and a dual core 2.6ghz cpu with nothing else running on the box. crazy!!</p>

<p><strong><a href="#188" title="2008-04-17 11:02:27">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Everyone Yep. I stood up a brand new Windows 2003 VM, nothing else on it except MS updates, and the new release of Mingle was still a CPU hog. This reminds me why I unsubscribed from the Thoughtworks RSS feed (it’s a Mingle marketing machine). I pray they get it right, it looks great with the few pages I’ve interacted with and what I’ve been reading. But to require that much memory/CPU power is unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#189" title="2008-08-15 17:19:25">tfriesen</a>:</strong> I also just installed Mingle as a test onto my Win XP workstation. I cannot believe the amount of resources this thing takes up. Come on … really … Mingle cannot be so complex that it needs this much! Tim</p>

                <p>You'd start to think that I'm no longer a developer, and more of a architecture IT person now with all of the latest Linux installation posts I've had lately.  These are do to the new tricks/fixes I'm having to learn to get Ubuntu Feisty Fawn to not be so feisty.  It's still better than Vista (for AgileJoe, knowing his comments are coming)</p>
<p>This past weekend I had a friend ask me to come over and help with a wireless printer server.  (Side Note:  D-Link Wireless printer servers claim to be using DHCP but they lie.  They are using static IPs.  You have to set your network IP scheme to match, get access to the print server, then set it's IP scheme to match your original IP scheme, then set your scheme back.  The reason I had to set his back was because SBC/AT&amp;T won't allow his internal IP scheme be anything but 192.168.1.x - Don't ask me.) I digress.</p>
<p>Anyways his Compaq Presario C500 laptop had Vista on it and it could see his printer but still couldn't print.  Same 'ol, same 'ol with there not being any Vista printer drivers ready. After an hour of looking for drivers I suggested Linux.  He had never heard of it.  I asked him if he trusted me and did he use any software that was specific to Windows.  He said yes to the first question and no to the second.</p>
<p>I took his laptop home and loaded Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn).  No problems.  I copied off his photos from his My Docs folder to my USB key drive and then plugged it in and put back in his /home/<username>/photos folder after loading Ubuntu. I could not get the wireless card to work.  It detected the interface and I verified that it was in the /etc/network/interfaces file.  The wireless blue key on the main board of the laptop would not light up no matter was I tried.</username></p>
<p>I plugged in my CAT5 cable and updated the OS with the latest patches and also loaded Automatix 2.0.  Got RealPlayer and a few other software programs loaded he mentioned that he liked.</p>
<p>Now to the core of this post.</p>
<p>I tried the following fixes and they DID NOT work for me:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=405990">Ubuntu Forums Thread 405990</a><br>
2. <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185174">Ubuntu Forums Thread 185874</a>  </p>
<p>I tried the following post (all commands literally) and it WORKED great:</p>

                <p>Interested information from another Linux board:</p>
<p><em>"Anyways, a couple of days ago I had a major hard drive crash that corrupted<br>
all my NTFS volumes. XP refused to boot, no safe mode, the recovery console<br>
wouldn't start, nothing. I was able to boot with the CD and navigate to my<br>
FAT32 volume (whoever said NTFS was more reliable than FAT32 was smokin'<br>
something). But unfortunately GHOST would hang at the start up screen.<br>
Apparently GHOST was just as unhappy with my corrupted NTFS vols as XP!<br>
So, I whipped out my Knoppix LiveCD (which happily mounted all the "corrupt"<br>
NTFS volumes. Sometimes I wonder why I still use Windows...) and did a<br>
ntfsfix on all the drive volumes (except the FAT32 obviously). Miraculously,<br>
that did the trick. XP booted up, performed all the chkdsk for each NTFS vol<br>
and everything looks normal."</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/knoppix-ntfsfix-fixes-windows-xp-corrupted-ntfs/#44" title="2008-05-02 23:40:11">Mike</a>:</strong> Well ... ntfsfix worked for me, too. I thought it was a bad disk. Win2K said it couldn't find the boot volume. I booted with the knoppix cd to see whether the machine was fried. Came up fine, so I decided to mount the windoze partition. Couldn't, but suggested running ntfsfix. Then, I could mount it. So, I rebooted into Win2K. It ran a check and booted fine. I'm still amazed!</p>

<p>I'm curious to see how it goes.  I'd love for my current position to allow for such a migration but the time needed is not there right now.  Maybe someday.</p>
<p>Also, Hammet, the key contributor and found of the Castle project, has <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">posted on Castle View Components</a>.  He links to Kevin Miller's blog <a href="http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/kmiller/archive/2007/05/08/monorail-and-3rd-party-viewcomponents.aspx">post about ASP.NET Controls vs. View Components</a> (I'm mentioned in this post, redirecting Kevin to <a href="http://joeydotnet.com/blog/category/16.aspx">JoeyDotNet's View Component posts</a> - shameless plug).</p>
<p>I'm going to pursue more personal development time to MonoRail.</p>

The other results in a cleaner design, but will take longer to put in place</em>."</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">Martin Fowler</a></p>
<p>Oren (Ayende) <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/05/04/Beware-of-the-technical-solution.aspx">posted</a> about "drawing a line in the sand" when it comes to making the decision about when to "hack" your software for some new business requirement.  He is all about refactoring your code to allow for the change to be implemented and maintained correctly.  I agree completely.  In the past we (developers) have all been guilty of "hacking" software to get it out the door to please the client.  This results in a maintenance nightmare and if we don't take the time to refactor the code, we know the next developer after us, sometimes even ourselves, won't be able to extend the domain model easily.</p>
<p>On one side project, the team I was on had test coverage on the domain model and deployed the code successfully.  There were 3 bugs (business requirements that were misunderstood prior to deployment) and I made the changes the next iteration.  At least I tried.  The domain was VERY ugly.  Do to some quick and dirty coding strategies, the code became unextensible.  I spent more time refactoring the code to make it extensible than I did implementing the changes.  The client was someone who understood software development and didn't mind the time necessary to make the changes.  They were especially happy when the next time they had changes, they were implemented in 1 iteration (1 week).  This was only possible due to the changes made in the prior release (refactoring).</p>
<p>This helps me re-emphasize RED, GREEN, REFACTOR.  Write a failing test, make it pass (at all costs), and then refactor.  I've met too many developers who have been awesome at red and green, but not refactor (I am by no means a master either).  Ideally, if the test is truely a unit test, the refactor should not be very hard or take very long (Hopefully).</p>
<p>Refactoring helps us avoid technical debt.  <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ComplexityAsDebt">Ward Cunningham</a> puts it best with "<em>Refactoring is like repaying principal</em>".</p>
<p>Reducing the "interest" payments in the future by paying down the "principal" is a good thing.  Of course, ideally, developers should refactor quickly and effectively after every unit test, but we all have been in a shop that expects to release on a specific date.  We can get test coverage and context coverage and have all green tests, but still create technical debt.  In this situation, I believe it is acceptable as long as there is intent and action taken to bring the technical debt down ASAP.  I've worked on software that needed to get out to market to beat the competition.  It happens.</p>
<p><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/default.aspx">Jeffrey Palermo</a> recently gave a presentation at the Austin .NET Users Group Code Camp about "Fundamentals of modern programming" and the main focus was to avoid complexity.  He gave good insight into this and he will be speaking at the Alamo Coders meeting on July 10, 2007 and presenting the core of that presentation.</p>

<p>It is a 30 Mb ISO image and, when burned to CD, is bootable.</p>

<p>Some of he claims according to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/">this</a> article:</p>
<h6><em>"But he does break down the total number allegedly violated - 235 - into categories. He says that the Linux kernel - the deepest layer of the free operating system, which interacts most directly with the computer hardware - violates 42 Microsoft patents. The Linux graphical user interfaces - essentially, the way design elements like menus and toolbars are set up - run afoul of another 65, he claims. The Open Office suite of programs, which is analogous to Microsoft Office, infringes 45 more. E-mail programs infringe 15, while other assorted FOSS programs allegedly transgress 68."</em></h6>
<p>I have researched the Novell, Microsoft pact and realized that Novell pretty much claimed that the Linux operating system infringed on Microsoft patents.  They did this by their portion of the deal stating that Microsoft could not sue them for patent infringement against the Novell Suse Operation System.  They had nothing to worry about.  Programs/Operating Systems are code and code falls under mathematical equations according to patents.  You can't patent a mathematical equation.</p>
<p>With all the hoopla about patent law and software, it should all come to a head soon.  The "hoopla" consists of the U.S. Government admitting that patents have been handed out too frivolously the last 2 decades.  The courts are starting to disagree with some of the software patent claims.</p>
<p>I'm not worried and nobody else should be.</p>
<p>When Microsoft starts to try and collect royalties from it's clients because they know they can't do it from Linux distributors, I predict a major shift in the Operating System usage market.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Great quote from the article:<br>
<strong><em>"It's a cold war, and what keeps the peace is the threat of mutually assured destruction: patent Armageddon - an unending series of suits and countersuits that would hobble the industry and its customers."</em></strong></p>
<p>P.S.  I just got one of my brother-in-laws (1 out of 5) to switch to Ubuntu.  It was awesome.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=392350&amp;highlight=toshiba">post</a> here on the forums helped me solve my problems.</p>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<p>open a terminal and type: </p>
<p>sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base</p>
<p>Go to the bottom of the file and paste in the following line: </p>
<p>options snd-hda-intel model=auto</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>options snd-hda-intel model=3stack</p>
<p>Exit anything that might be playing sound or has to do with sound.  </p>
<p>Back in the terminal, type </p>
<p>sudo rmmod snd_hda_intel</p>
<p>Then </p>
<p>sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel</p>
<p>Now test sound again.</p>
<p>This post is more of a reminder for me when I decide to finally remove my Windows partition on my laptop and reinstall Feisty on the entire hard drive.  Don't want to have to hunt this down again.</p>
<p>Note: To all you Linux haters who want to use this as an example of why you won't switch to Linux....one word: Vista.  How many of your peripherals didn't work after you upgraded?  Nuff said.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong...Microsoft programming pays my bills, but Linux programming and usage keeps my bank account happy :)</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/getting-sound-working-on-my-toshiba-laptop-with-ubuntu-7-04-feisty-fawn/#25" title="2007-05-14 21:35:00">agilejoe</a>:</strong> How about explaining what the command line is doing for the newbie’s out there? That is one of the problems that Linux users have. They assume everyone that uses Linux is a command line junkie and know what every command is. Documentation is a wonderful thing when it comes to usability of an OS. My two cents.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/getting-sound-working-on-my-toshiba-laptop-with-ubuntu-7-04-feisty-fawn/#26" title="2007-05-15 00:32:09">jmeridth</a>:</strong> Understandable: Comand explanation: Sudo = allows a permitted user to run a command as the superuser or another user specified in the sudoers file (located at /etc/sudoers on ubuntu) Rmmod – unloads the loadable module (snd_hda_intel) from the kernel (with restriction that they are not in use and not referred to by other modules) Modprobe – attempts to load the specified module into the kernel for usage. In this case my sound module (snd_hda_intel) What the changes above is tell the kernel specifically what type of sound card I have and unload, then reload the module. Hope this answers your questions.</p>

Granted I have to pray it works but visually I remember what I am doing. LOL</p>

After I do that I notice the annoying affirmation messages seem to subside.</p>

I am following your steps but it won't let me rmmod as it says snd_hda_intel is in use. How do I make it not be in use so that I can continue with the rest of the steps? Thanks</p>

I've been on the forums and this post doesn't work for everyone. I thought the command-line commands above in the post qualified as HOW.</p>

It is specific to certain Intel sound cards in certain Toshiba laptops. Glad yours is not one of them. :) the media player buttons and touchpad stuff is specific to your laptop. It depends on which one you have: example ubuntuforum post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3470007 I'll email you this information also and work with you to solve the issue. I'm just posting here to help anyone else. Thanks.</p>

I tried adding the lines to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base but that did not work. I finally got it working by passing "pci=routeirq" to the kernel. Here is a link to the fix.

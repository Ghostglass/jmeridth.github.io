                <p>_<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Make sure your user account is a member of the vboxusers account.  VirtualBox will not start and the error will tell you this, but just want to be explicit.  You will have to logout and log back in. _  </p>
<p>I recently upgraded my Ubuntu to the latest version, as mentioned in a previous post.  I'm very excited about it, due to greater support for hardware items that I've had to fight battles with (one of the many reasons people won't make the switch to Linux).  I upgraded to Hardy Heron and then upgraded VirtualBox when prompted.  It was a fatal hardware recognition mistake.  As soon as I booted back up after a restart, I didn't have sound, wireless, etc. </p>
<p>After just not being in the mood of going down the road of trying to get the hardware re-recognized, I reloaded and di my research on the virtualbox upgrade.  It seems to be a known issue on the ubuntuforms. </p>
<p>I looked through the forums and got educated on a few things about the ose (open source edition) versions of VirtualBox.  1. no usb support (I will update if I'm proved wrong). 2. the new ose kernel modules hose toshiba satellite hardware detection (at least on my laptop).</p>
<p>To get the gutsy non-ose version of Virtual Box, add this repository to /etc/apt/sources.list:  </p>
<p>deb http://www.virtualbox.org/debian gutsy non-free   </p>
<p>then in a terminal:</p>
<p>apt-get update<br>
apt-get install virtualbox   </p>
<p>if you get a host key issue, the do the following:</p>
<p>go get the public key.. go to this website and it'll have the key there just right click anywhere in the page and go to save page as then save it to your home directory preferably.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/debian/innotek.asc">http://www.virtualbox.org/debian/innotek.asc</a>  </p>
<p>Now to add that key run...  </p>
<p>apt-key add innotek.asc<br>
apt-get update<br>
apt-get install virtualbox</p>
<p>This will give you the gutsy version that I've worked with and have had no problems with.  The bonus is that you get USB support. </p>
<p>I will get back to code posts next.  Just want to share the knowledge with other Linux users.</p>

I still had a slight problem afterwards, I needed to add myself to the usbfs group, etc, but that is easily done. Many thanks!</p>

I did this. It installed fine. It runs. But then when I bring up the settings for my virtual machine I get this: Could not load the Host USB Proxy Service (VERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)</p>

You also have to grant some permissions shown in the post. I didn't have this issue, but it seems to be related to the same thing that JLangbridge had. Thanks.</p>

I don't know about Opera. I'm a Firefox guy. I'm enjoying the Firefox 3 Beta 5 install that is default with 8.04. If you do decide to upgrade, please let me know about Opera.</p>

It's been a while! Hope you remember me as the guy who was skeptical about upgrading to ubuntu 8.04 in relation to virtualbox - I still got cold feet so I'm staying with 7.10.... Anyway, I got a question for you... I downloaded a folder icon with a .png extension and I want to make that my default folder icon throughout my ubuntu 7.10. What must I do for that? Also, I want to do the same thing to tar files - I want to change the icon for tar.bz2 and tar.gz files throughtout my system. What must I do?</p>

Ha ha... That's ok. One of the repliers on it had recommended that I open up nautilus and then substitute the icon in usr/share/icons. But, he cautions that the icon must be the same size as the icon I'm substituting. I see many folders in there and in particular, there are folders denoted with 22x22, 24x24, 32x32, etc. Which would be the right one? I don't want to mess up my system if something should go wrong. Thanks, Jason!</p>

Actually, I went ahead and installed an icon theme. This was getting frustrating for me. And, sorry about giving you a headache over my little icon issue. However, I got a question regarding this. How can I change icons for files like, doc, mp3, zip, mov, openoffice files, etc. I just don't want to simply change an individual icon on my desktop. I want to make changes globally. Must must I do?

Hope you and the wife are doing well. I got a question. My Ubuntu 7.10 has been running slow lately. I've deleted stuff in my trash but it's still running slow. Are there any management tools I can download to make Ubuntu run more efficiently and faster? Sort of like, XP's defragmentor? Also, I checked my CPU usage and found that the plugin for Opera is running 80% of my CPU usage. Any ideas?</p>

Oh WOW, Jason... I really need your help now!!! I know you and the misses are expecting a child soon so I don't mean to disrupt that, but when you have time, please help me with this problem!

The session might encounter issues if the computer clock is not properly configured. Please consider adjusting it. Current date is 01/01/1988." It was then suggested that I replace the CMOS battery with a new one, chich I did. I then entered 'date' and 'hwclock' in terminal to see if the system is in sync.

<p>I'm writing this, because it's about the 5th time I've had to use my Windows box or VM to get iso files from MSDN.   </p>
<p><rant>   </rant></p>
<p>I understand, in a business manner, why Microsoft won't allow downloads from Firefox at MSDN.  I work for a company that was kind enough to give me a MSDN license.  I've used it a great deal to get software like Vistual Studio 2008 and SQL Server 2008 recently.  I also use it for the iso files I use in my VMs.  I recently had to download Vista again and from Firefox the specific items I want (the checkboxes in MSDN's new Silverlight UI) are grayed out.  COME ON!!!!!</p>
<p>I use Firefox more than I use Internet Explorer.  And before, you non-Linux users tell me about the IE tab plugin for Firefox, let me remind you that you still have to have iexplore.exe on your PC.  Linux doesn't have it (and shouldn't).</p>
<p>I like where Microsoft development teams are going recently (Guthrie, Haack, Conery, etc), but the MSDN team needs to wake up and open the ability to download items via Firefox.</p>
<p>If someone out there knows a way to do this with Firefox, I will update this post and eat some humble pie.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/msdn-can-t-download-with-firefox/#234" title="2008-04-27 04:53:09">James Nguyen</a>:</strong> Download and install MS FTM (file transfer manager) at http://transfers.one.microsoft.com/ftm/default.aspx?Target=install Then when you use FF while browsing MSDN, click a download link, then specify to open the link with the FTM app. For me, FF already had the app specified as the preferred app, you may have to do file | browse to the path. Up pops the standard MSDN file transfer dialog, specify the path, and boom, you're golden.</p>

                <p>_<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Do not upgrade your virtual box install.  Stay with the Gutsy version if you already have it.  If you are just installing Hardy Heron from scratch, I will have a post in a little bit and link to it here about how to ensure you get the correct version. _</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2007/05/12/getting-sound-working-on-my-toshiba-laptop-with-ubuntu-7-04-feisty-fawn.aspx">post</a>, I shared the pain of getting sound working on my Toshiba Satellite laptop with prior versions of Ubuntu.  It has been off and on for a while and I've even resorting to recompiling my kernel to get it to work (no luck).  After upgrading to Hardy Heron today and restarting, I heard the wonderful drum sounds you here when Ubuntu loands.  YIPEE!!  I just logged in and finally got to watch some of the CodeBetter screencasts on the Seattle conference on my laptop without having to use my Windows VM.  For some reason, when I plugged headphones in and used my Windows VM, I got sound.</p>
<p>I also got the latest beta of Firfox 3.0.  Wow.  My del.icio.us plugin was not compatible, but I did find the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5457">Shareaholic</a> plugin that lets you post to Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Digg, Del.icio.us, etc.  Nice.  A few special effects also.</p>
<p>I noticed that the OS also has indexing in place now, so you can search for programs like you do with Vista.</p>
<p>There are other new features that I'm excited about, but will use them in greater detail before I blog about them.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong folks.  Microsoft pays my bills with the day job, but I like Linux for personal reasons (oh and it's free).  Just want to share in case anyone is thinking about switching or is currently using and hasn't upgraded. I finally got my Vista VM up and I'm working in IronPython again.  I plan to post on that soon.</p>
<p>I'm just very happy my sound is working flawlessly.</p>

I followed the guided to install PulseAudio (which should have already been installed) and things started working. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PulseAudio I will be looking into adding a VM so that I can do .Net dev.</p>

<p>I'm currently on Gutsy Gibbon (7.10), the previous version.  I'm upgrading after I post this.  I'll update this post afterwards.</p>
<p>Also, for all you hesitant Linux users out there, on this version of distribution you can get the iso, create a CD and put in your windows box and install Ubuntu like a Windows application.  This tool is called <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/804rc#head-87d0a87aa86aa19685191dac8a85075a9b4dbc7b">Wubi</a>.  This will let you see what Linux has to offer.    </p>

<p>Also, if you haven't, go check out Virtual Box, so if you decide to make the switch, you can still have your Windows fix for pleasure or development in a nice VM.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/ubuntu-8-04-came-out-today-hardy-heron/#230" title="2008-04-25 12:07:55">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> @Gates Just for fun. To try something new. If you feel more comfortable on a Mac or Windows, by all means, stick with it. Ubuntu is just my choice of primary OS and I like to share any updates with my readers. I haven't tried a Mac yet, but I've been hearing all the great praise. I've witnessed the use of VMWare Fusion and was impressed. To each his own. Can't hurt to try a free operating system, though, could it?</p>

<p>Get the new Adobe Air (Alpha) download for Linux from <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">here.</a></p>
<p>Go to where you downloaded it and type the following, to install it:</p>
<p>chmod +x  adobeair_linux_a1_033108.bin<br>
./adobeair_linux_a1_033108.bin</p>
<p>Go download Twhirl from <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/project/twhirl">here:</a></p>
<p>I let the adobe air installer take it and let it install in the suggested folder (in case there are any dependencies on the air libraries that I don't know of).</p>
<p>Last install screen will ask you if you want to start Twhirl up.  Do it!  Enjoy!!  </p>

If you want to update, this install also works in Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron and with Twhirl ver. 0.8. Couldn't get ver. 1.0 to download into Linux though.</p>

And instead of running the code, drag the file into a Terminal window to start the installation.</p>

                <h4>The Single Responsibility Principle</h4>
<p>This post is about the first letter in Uncle Bob's SOLID acronym, <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf">Single Responsibility Principle</a>, and a continuation of <a href="posts/ptom-single-responsibility-principle/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/03/07/pablo-s-topic-of-the-month-march-solid-principles.aspx">The Los Techies Pablo's Topic of the Month - March: SOLID Principles</a>.  Sean has already <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/archive/2008/03/15/ptom-single-responsibility-principle.aspx">posted</a> on this, but I'd like to "contribute".  <em><strong>Note about the SOLID acronym and this blog "storm"</strong>: This "principle" is more or less common sense, as are most of the other items in the SOLID acronym.  I like the idea of this series because I personally have interviewed with companies who would ask about possible code scenarios and I respond with one of these principles or one of the GOF patterns and they look back at me with a blank stare.  I know these are just labels, but if they can reduce the miscommunication possibilities and start standardizing our industry, I'm all for it.  I know some of the new ideas and labels out there are still being hammered out (i.e., like the BDD discussions as of late), but that is part of the process and what has to happen in such a young industry like ours.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP):  A class should have only one reason to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good anti-example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern">Active Record pattern</a>.  This pattern is in contradiction of SRP.  A domain entity handles persistence of it's information. (Note: There is nothing wrong with using Active Record; I've recently used it on a quick demo site and it worked perfectly)  Normally, you would have a controller method/action pass a "hydrated" entity to a method of a repository instance.  Like my favorite quote says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk is cheap, show me the code ~ Linus Torvalds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>let's look at some .NET code.</p>
<h5><strong>Anti-SRP (Active Record)</strong></h5>
<p>Imagine you have a User entity that has a username and password property.  I'm using the Castle Active Record libraries for this example. [gist id=4542522 file=ptom_single_responsibility_example1.cs] </p>
<h5>As you can see you use attributes to dictate how your properties map to columns in your database table.  Your entity name usually matches your table name, when using just the ActiveRecord attribute with no explicit table name (i.e., [ActiveRecord("UserTableName")].</h5>
<p>To save the user you would take an instantiated user and just call user.Save();  This would cause an update to fire if the user instance had identity (aka an Id) and insert if it did not. </p>
<h5><strong>Translation to SRP</strong></h5>
<p>What I would normally do is have an architecture like the following: <img alt="image" src="posts/ptom-single-responsibility-principle/jasonmeridth/files/WindowsLiveWriter/PTOMSingleResponsibilityPrinciple_13E55/image_4.png"> The UserRepository would be used by a web controller (I use monorail for my web projects), being passed a User instance, and Save(user) would be called. [gist id=4542559 file=ptom_single_responsibility_example2.cs] So, what it boils down to is that the user class now knows nothing on how it is persisted to the database. SRP is one of the hardest principles to enforce because there is always room for refactoring out one class to multiple; each class has one responsibility.  It is personal preference because class explosion does cause some people to become code zealots.  One of my other favorite quotes lately is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always code as if the guy maintaining your code would be a violent psychopath and he knows where you live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/ptom-single-responsibility-principle/#224" title="2008-11-18 12:48:53">Martin Odhelius</a>:</strong> The last pattern you are using actually looks like the Data Acess Object-pattern (DAO) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Access_Object and is in fact much better than the Active Record-pattern in most situations, especially when you want to handle several different data sources or when you want to migrate data between different db:s for example.</p>

                <p>As a "computer guy" I am always asked about everything technical.  One of the latest most popular questions has been, "Should I get an XBOX 360 or Playstation 3?".  My answer as of late has been, "Which one do you like more: Halo or Blu-ray?".  I personally purchased a 360 because I love to play Halo.  If someone is purchasing it for the ability to play HD DVDs then they should get a Playstation 3.</p>
<p>The reason for this goodbye gesture is that Microsoft has stated they will be discontinuing the HD-DVD add-on device for the XBOX 360 as your can read <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ifXeLMB28kre9AK-YgVq7Y4ZEJ9wD8V0RI780">here.</a> </p>
<p>I think everyone knew this was coming around the corner, but when MS jumps ship you know that VHS has beaten Beta, oh I mean.....Blu-ray has beaten HD-DVD.</p>

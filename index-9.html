<p>Brad Abrams, Group manager of the .NET Framework, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2007/09/18/phil-haack-joins-the-ranks.aspx">posted today</a> announcing the Microsoft hiring of Phil Haack, core SubText blogging engine developer.  Brad mentions that Phil will head the team to bring about a <strong>MVC architecture for ASP.NET.</strong>  I've followed Phil's blog and am glad to hear people of his talent will be behind that movement.  He even mentions speaking with Scott Guthrie at Redmond and stating that he wants to work on the MVC Framework (<a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx">here</a>), and voila!! I'm still on the MonoRail bandwagon, but we all know that if Microsoft comes out with a MVC Framework, it will most likely be accepted as the standard (whether or not it is the better of the MVC frameworks).  Hopefully, MS will listen to the industry on what is needed for that idea to succeed.</p>

<p>My co-worker, <a href="http://codemonkey.nmonta.com/">Nelson</a>, and I did some remote pair programming on a side project this weekend.  He had talked about <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype </a>and the <a href="http://www.yugma.com/yugmaskype/">YugmaSkype </a>plug-in for a couple days.  I finally went by Altex and purchased some <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/webcam_communications/internet_headsets_phones/devices/230&amp;cl=us,en">Logitech Premium USB Headset 350</a> (mic included) = $45+. When I got home I IMed Nelson and brought up Skype. He initiated the call.  It's just like talking on the phone.  (Before you purchase headphones, check the <a href="http://us.accessories.skype.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayCategoryListPage&amp;SiteID=skype&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;Env=BASE&amp;categoryID=4141900&amp;cm_mmc=google/search-_-brand_hw-_-US/EN-_-america/WO-NA-US:EN:HW/skype%20headset/skype%20headset/Broad/916407746">skype certified list)</a>  </p>
<p>NOTICE: The logitech headphones have a volume control but beware that the center (black) logitech button is the mute button, not the volume control.  The surrounding grey circle is the volume control.<br>
<img alt="Premium USB Headset 350" src="http://www.logitech.com/repository/295/jpg/2076.1.0.jpg"></p>
<p>Once in there, you need to make sure you install YugmaSkype.  Once installed, you can initiate a session to share you desktop.  You can share your desktop, as the presenter or the other people can share their desktop.  Just like PCAnywhere or NetMeeting.  You can grant specific people control of your desktop.</p>
<p>It was remote TDD at it's finest.</p>
<p>He'd write a test, I make it pass.  I'd write a test, he'd make it pass.</p>
<p>It was a blast, and a heck of lot simpler than me writing a test, checking-in, him getting latest and making it past, and using IM/Phone to talk.</p>
<p>Hope this helps any other remote agile developers out there.</p>
<p>This was found by <a href="http://codemonkey.nmonta.com/">Nelson</a>, I just happen to get the blog written. </p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/skype-yugma-logitech-premium-usb-headset-350-remote-pair-programming/#89" title="2007-09-17 17:25:29">Nelson Montalvo</a>:</strong> It was a great session. I was surprised by how fluid our communication was, ping-ponging back and forth - not just on tests, but any other issue that came up. </p>
<p>It still doesn't beat sitting next to each other, but it was productive. The point of this is NOT to replace side-by-side pairing, but to facilitate some form of pairing when we just CAN'T be in the same room.</p>
<p>We'll need to experiment with web cams and online whiteboards.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/skype-yugma-logitech-premium-usb-headset-350-remote-pair-programming/#90" title="2007-09-18 00:15:30">Zack</a>:</strong> Hey guys... this is great. I tried it out. Skype plus Yugma is awesome!!! I'm loving it. Highly recommend others check out. Fast, easy, and price is right (free!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/skype-yugma-logitech-premium-usb-headset-350-remote-pair-programming/#91" title="2007-09-18 01:04:59">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Glad to hear it Zack. Thanks for reading.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/skype-yugma-logitech-premium-usb-headset-350-remote-pair-programming/#92" title="2007-09-18 06:56:07">Nelson Montalvo</a>:</strong> Alas, great things are not for free... I should have read the fine print... Yugma and Wedbialog's Unyte application offer the best part of their collaboration tools for remote sharing- sharing of the mouse and keyboard - for free only for a limited time. Non-interactive desktop sharing remains free. Oh well, might still be worth it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/skype-yugma-logitech-premium-usb-headset-350-remote-pair-programming/#93" title="2007-09-18 15:00:56">Donn Felker</a>:</strong> Yeah, I think it would still be worth it. Even for those moments where the parents call up and say "How do I set up my email in outlook?"</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/skype-yugma-logitech-premium-usb-headset-350-remote-pair-programming/#94" title="2007-10-03 08:14:02">Nelson Montalvo</a>:</strong> One last note on this... Jason and I found Elluminate vRoom a while back: http://www.elluminate.com/vroom/ Free up to 3 people and works really well for the desktop sharing. The interface, overall, is clunky and we dropped the use of pretty much anything else from it. However, once we got into an interactive session, it was a pretty useful application for the price (free). Skype voice and your favorite IM client should supplement this application pretty well. Again, only to be used in those hopefully rare "remote pairing" situations.</p>

<p>Currently I'm working on a team of 8 developers and have been practicing Agile for just under 2 years now.  I read about it and tried a couple time before this 2 year span, but didn't realize how wrong I was approaching it.  <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx">Scott Bellware</a> has been posting about how <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/09/09/167738.aspx">Agile development does not have the answers</a> and this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The essence of TDD is a suspension of our belief that we know what we're doing, and a submission to a structured process of exploration and elaboration of ideas."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I think that the difference between a good developer and an excellent developer is the excellent developer's willingness to not know, an openness to explore, and faith in skills that guide solutions to good ends even when the end is not known at the outset."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The team I'm on practices an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">Extreme Programming</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">Scrum</a> process and my <strike>manager</strike> Agile coach, <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo">AgileJoe</a>, makes a good point when he states that an XP value he believes should be in the core values is Humility.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming#XP_values">The current list</a> is awesome, but humility allows for the items that Scott mentions in his post.</p>
<p>When I tried to get a different department in the same company to change it's process to Agile, I met great resistance (as expected).  Change = fear.  The greatest fear was from the programmers on the team that specialized in one section of the software and were afraid of either learning a new portion or having other developers critique their code.  One of the core values of Extreme Programming is courage and it was hard getting that across.  Scott speaks the truth when he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Agile will show you more problems than you ever thought you had before you start to see some progress against these problems."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much courage is needed to take that step.  If you are blessed to have the process started by an Agile coach, like the team I'm currently on (they had Michael Feathers from Object Mentor pay a visit), then the "sparking" of the process may be a little easier than a complete agile newbie (myself on the other team) trying to get it going. </p>
<p>I don't claim to be a excellent developer or an agile master, but in the environment I'm working in we strive to minimize any hero programmers and focus on code ownership amongst the group.  By doing this you allow for everyone to grok the entire domain.</p>
<p>To expand on his post, if your unit tests are precise and truly cover a specific behavior, it is easier for a future developer to learn and join the rest of the team in mastering the domain.  I won't get into the multiple xDDs you can practice to achieve this, just as long as you have a way of doing it. We practice a mixture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-Driven Development</a>, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2006/12/domain-driven-design">Domain-Driven Design</a>, and <a href="http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd">Behavior-Driven Development/Design</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/agile-development/#82" title="2007-09-10 04:13:53">Joe Ocampo</a>:</strong> I prefer the term coach over Manager... :-) Managers manage -- A coach leads! Nice post.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/agile-development/#83" title="2007-09-10 12:28:14">jlockwood</a>:</strong> Nice post... Just a couple of quick notes (and history): The addition of 'humility' to the team's core values was inspired by the earlier writings of Scott Ambler as he was developing the concept of Agile Modeling (see Agile Modeling: Effective Practices for Extreme Programming and the Unified Process - Ambler). We thought that humility was a key (and often missing) element in the typical approaches toward team development and threw it in once discovered. Bellware and I were first trying to help the World Savings team we worked with (and that you work with now) move from a disfuntional water fall-based process to an agile approach (namely XP). I think that we both lacked humility (and respect for that matter) at first when trying to sell the idea, largely due to our frustration with heavy resistance from team members on both development and business sides. Had humility and respect been among our watchwords during the process things may have (may have I stress) gone a bit smoother. At the time of the addition of 'humility' to our XP-base core values, the XP core values were (initiated circa 1999): 1. Communication 2. Simplicity 3. Feedback 4. Courage Over time, I think that the concept of humility has become integral to the team and part of its very culture. I was quite impressed when seeing you guys work recently; the business and developers where playing quite well together and productivity was such that Wachovia has been forced to take notice in the post-merger environment. As I saw on the link you provided, 'Respect' has now been added to the list of XP core values. 'Respect' and 'Humility' are not synonyms, but do seem to have a bit of mutual interdependence. Without either, it's quite difficult to develop a cohesive team. Agile development approaches, like many sports, rely heavily on team cohesion and good 'sportsmanship' among the team's players in order for teams to 'win'. Finally, we did have Feathers come and he was helpful and inspirational (I want to be like him when I grow up...if I grow up). He helped mainly with TDD in C# and introduced us to Fitnesse (this focused on the Simplicity and Feedback values). The team building part, unfortunately, we had to figure out on our own. We brought our own Courage, figured out (through much trial and error) how to improve Communication and Feedback in a way that worked for us, and along the way learned just how important Humility is along the way in helping assure the first four values. Keep up the good fight team Wachovia!</p>

<p>To all bloggers out there that post code into their blog and also use Windows Live Writer, HELP!</p>
<p>I was currently using <a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d8835a5e-28da-4242-82eb-e1a006b083b9&amp;bt=9&amp;pl=8">VSPaste plug-in</a>.  It looks great when writing the entry in the Live Writer; even the web preview looks great:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="posts/code-snippets-in-blog-entries-help/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03CodesnippetsinblogentriesHELP_6F6A/image_thumb.png"></p>
<p>Notice the pretty colors.  When uploaded, the code is just black text with no styles applied.  A colleague spoke with Community Server and they suggested removing any custom CSS that may overwrite what styles the VSPaste plug-in is using. </p>
<p>I saw the <a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d4409446-af7f-42ec-aa20-78aa5bac4748&amp;bt=9&amp;pl=8">Code Snippet Plug-in</a> and downloaded it, but no matter how much I try, I can't get it to show up in my list of plug-ins (Tools-&gt; Options-&gt; Plug-ins):</p>

<p>Any suggestions??</p>
<p>Yes, I know, I'm a developer, custom CSS is always an option too. I'd like to try tools that are out there first, please. :)</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/code-snippets-in-blog-entries-help/#80" title="2007-09-09 18:04:06">joeyDotNet</a>:</strong> Hey Jason, I've tried out many of them and the best one I've found so far (if you're a WLW user as I am), is this code snippet plug-in for WLW: http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=d4409446-af7f-42ec-aa20-78aa5bac4748&amp;bt;=9&amp;pl;=8</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/code-snippets-in-blog-entries-help/#81" title="2007-09-09 19:21:24">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Sweet. I figured as much, but when I run the MSI it installs, but I can't find the plugin in my plugins window in WLW. Any suggestions? Am I having a newbie brain-fart? This is used in WLW and not VS 2005/2008, right?</p>

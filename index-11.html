<em>Finally. Yeah, it got delayed, not because of any huge issues, but because of various bugfixes trickling in and causing me to reset my 'release clock' all the time. But it's out there now, and hopefully better for the wait,</em>" Linus Torvalds said <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2007/10/9/333488">announcing the 2.6.23 kernel</a>. He noted few changes since the last release candidate, "<em>not a whole lot of changes since -rc9, although there's a few updates to mips, sparc64 and blackfin in there. Ignoring those arch updates, there's basically a number of mostly one-liners (mostly in drivers, but there's some networking fixes and soem VFS/VM fixes there too).</em>" Source level changes can be viewed via the <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=summary">gitweb interface</a>. A nice overview of all changes can be found at <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_23">Kernel Newbies</a>. Linus went on to describe his plan going forward:</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>"I want this to be what people look at for a few days, but expect the x86 merge to go ahead after that. So far, all indications are still that it's going to be all smooth sailing, but hey, those indicators seem to always say that, and only after the fact do people notice any problems ;)"</p>

                <p>Please read Colin's <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/2007/10/07/abandon-altnet/">post</a> and then read my <a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/2007/10/07/abandon-altnet/#comment-3603">comment</a> response to a blog entry I just read from Colin Ramsay (<a href="http://colinramsay.co.uk/2007/10/07/abandon-altnet/">post here</a>).</p>
<p>I apologize for posting my Hanselman <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/archive/2007/10/05/alt-net.aspx">quote</a> out of context.  Scott said it in a joking manner without dergotory tone.  No one at the conference liked the term Mort and during the "How to invoke passion on your team" session we tried to define "Mort", so that if it was used (due to habit, not malice) we knew what the speaker was saying.</p>
<p>Please do not bash anyone who went to the conference.</p>
<p>There were 2 things I got out of it that were great FOR ME:</p>
<p>1. I finally got to put some faces to some bloggers I have been reading.<br>
2. I got to interact with passionate, non-egotistical, professional individuals who want to code better software.</p>
<p>How we (the entire software community) might want to do that, with what possible techniques and with what possible tools were discussed.</p>
<p>For anyone who does not like the term "Alt.NET" please spend the time to look past the label and read some of the posts of other developers who went and got some positive things out of it.  Please be professional and polite.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of room for debate and discussion, but let's keep it civil.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/quot-alt-net-quot-conference-was-not-for-fanboys/#157" title="2007-10-10 07:56:58">Brad Mead</a>:</strong> Hey J.D. ! So glad I found your blog. I was the one who came up to you after the "passion" session and said I wanted to work with you to get some collective "noob" learning stuff going. I'm busy deciding on DasBlog2 vs Subtext but will be up and running in a short time. Looking forward to some online discussion and collboration</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/quot-alt-net-quot-conference-was-not-for-fanboys/#158" title="2007-10-10 10:31:09">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> Excellent Brad. I'm taking a little break before hitting it hard again. Each of those blogging engines are excellent. Check out Oren (Ayende.com/blog) blog about why he switched from dasblog to subtext, or check out Ben Scheirman's blog on why he loves dasblog (flux88.com). Look forward to the communication bro.</p>

                <p>Wow!</p>
<p>I just left a presentation by Scott Guthrie on the new ASP.NET MVC architecture and I'm impressed.</p>
<p>His opening slide was:  </p>
<p>Principles:<br>
-Separation of concerns, unit testing, red/green TDD, maintainable<br>
-Extensible and pluggable<br>
-Enable clean urls and HTML<br>
-Integrate nicely within ASP.NET + .NET core code, support static + dynamic languages</p>
<p>Jeffrey Palermo, has a great post on it in more detail <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/10/05/altnetconf-scott-guthrie-announces-asp-net-mvc-framework-at-alt-net-conf.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>EVERYTHING is interface based and goes through the controller/actions first.</p>
<p>IHttpRequest and IHttpResponse are completely mockable.</p>
<p>My daily summation is coming tonight.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.  I'm headed to the DDD session now.</p>

                <p><em>Precursor: If you think I'm name dropping, I don't care.  I have an opportunity to interact with some of the most intelligent/influential people in our industry this weekend.  ALL QUOTES IN THIS ENTRY ARE PARAPHRASED AS I DO NOT HAVE TAPE RECORDING.</em></p>
<p>This evening was amazing.  I had the opportunity to meet some of my idols and some of the biggest names in our industry.  If you want to see the list, check it <a href="http://www.altnetconf.com/participants">here</a>. </p>
<p>We got to the hotel and checked into our rooms.  I headed down to the lobby to meet the other guys (<a href="http://blog.agilejoe.com">Joe Ocampo</a>, Phil Dennis, <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jasdeep_singh">Jasdeep Singh</a>) in my group.  I was surprised to see <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> checking in.  The only reason I recognized him was from the picture on his blog.  He shook hands with someone sitting on the couch in the lobby.  After he headed up the elevator, I decided to meet the other people and introduced myself.  In the group was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/">Jim Newkirk</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/">Jamie Cansdale,</a> and <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy">Brad Wilson</a>.  Very cool.</p>
<p>We headed to the facilities.  Once again my "curse of Austin" kicked in and we got lost.  (Please keep in mind that the facility is less than a mile from the hotel).  We finally made it there but my curse still holds.</p>
<p>When we arrived, everyone was doing the meet-and-greet.  It was nuts how many people I recognized due to photos on blogs.  I am definitely going to see if the guys on LosTechies want to switch back to real photos.  Maybe not, the simpsonized photos are fun. The first person I met was <a href="http://www.jameskovacs.com/blog/">James Kovacs</a>.  He introduced himself and I said, "you're the man behind <a href="http://www.jameskovacs.com/blog/RhinoMocks305ReleasedWithExplicitRecordPlayback.aspx">the using statements in Rhino Mocks</a>."  He was surprised and said, "wow, my reputation precedes me."  Intelligent guy, approachable and was a pleasure to talk to.</p>
<p>Next I bumped into many other people I recognized and some I did not.  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/">Roy Osherove</a> was a blast.  He is funny and seems to care very much about what is best for our industry.  <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/">Scott</a>, was of course my hero of the night, representing LosTechies with the shirt he purchased.  He also organized this conference. In fact, the guys and I listened to his <a href="http://www.rubiverse.com">Rubiverse</a> <a href="http://static.rubiverse.com/podcasts/2-scott-bellware-on-microsoft-and-ruby.mp3">podcast</a> interview on the way up to Austin.  If you haven't heard it you really need to.</p>
<p>Some other names of people I met briefly: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a>, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a>, <a href="http://www.jeffreypalermo.com/">Jeffrey Palermo</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/default.aspx">Jeremy Miller</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/09/12/two-exciting-announcements-baby-and-ineta.aspx">Jeffrey was recently introduced into fatherhood</a>.  Congratulations again Jeffrey.</p>
<p>(Shameless plug:  Remember, if you like our blog or you just like the Pablo donkey, purchase a shirt or mug or mouse pad from the merchandise link above)</p>
<p>I was surprised to see the room laid out the way it was at the <a href="http://www.pec.stedwards.edu/index.asp">St. Edwards University Professional Education</a> facility.  Last time I was in there was for the Austin .NET Users group Code Camp back in July.  It had tables and each person was able to open their laptop and code/read email/etc.  This time it felt like a scrum/stand-up circle with chairs.  There were about 120+ people their.</p>
<p>We all sat and Scott Bellware gave a basic intro on what process we were going to follow for the event.  <a href="http://www.openspaceworld.org/">Open Spaces</a>.  I had heard of it, but admittedly had not researched it much.  I wanted the conference to teach me what it was.  Next "<a href="http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/slist/default.aspx">Doc" List</a>, our facilitator, went into some note cards and stated a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a 2 feet rule - if you don't like the session you are in, use your 2 feet and go to another session.</li>
<li>You are either a butterfly or a bumble bee:<ol>
<li>Butterfly: you stay in a session and possibly converse with the other people present</li>
<li>Bumble Bee: you travel between 2 or more sessions picking up and possibly contributing to them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next he had us go around the room, 1 at a time, stand and state our name, where we are from, and a blurb about what we expected out of this weekend.  My response was, "Jason Meridth, San Antonio, I hope to learn from the alpha geeks present at this conference and hopefully contribute".  The responses from a few were priceless one-liners but I can't recall them now.  The best one, that I believe summed up the expectation, was that the person wanted "my software to suck less."  I don't think it could be put any easier and more understood.</p>
<p>He also wanted to show us what a "fishbowl" session was.  He had <a href="http://www.io.com/~wazmo/blog">Brett Pettichord</a> explain that this consisted of 6 chairs, 5 people to start and a conversation.  He took Scott Bellware, James Kovacs, Martin Fowler, Dave Laribee, and another person I can't remember.  This left 1 chair open.  The idea was that a conversation would start and if someone in the audience wanted to contribute they would go up and sit in the sixth chair.  Someone, usually the person who has been in the group the longest (hopefully not currently speaking) gets up and joins the audience again.  Again, this leaves a chair open for another audience member to sit in if they want to contribute.</p>
<p>To sum up the conversation that ensued for the next hour would NOT do it justice, but I will try.  The first question was "Why is this considered alternative?".  James Kovacs handed that off to Martin Fowler because if you notice on the <a href="http://www.altnetconf.com/participants">list</a> that he signed up with that as his comment.  Martin's answer was great.  "Where I work, ThoughtWorks, these ideas and practices occur in our normal day practices and values." (I am paraphrasing, but you get the idea) </p>
<p>Other items that came up were Microsoft and it's processes, values, teachings.  I witnessed Scott Hanselman get very <strong>passionate</strong>.  I will not assume to paraphrase any portion of the conversation when this subject came up.  There was no cussing or anything, just a good deal of heated debate.</p>
<p>After all the conversation and such I had an opportunity to meet with <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/">Dave Laribee</a>.  I can only hope that the leaders in our industry can share the <strong>passion</strong> and concern about the people and processes that I witnessed Dave share tonight.  He made me realize that there are some seriously <strong>passionate</strong> people at this thing and I hope to be able to learn from them.</p>
<p>I also had an opportunity to meet with <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/">JP Boodhoo</a> and <a href="http://legacycoder.com/">Eric Hexter</a> after the "fishbowl".  JP is another person that has a <strong>passion</strong> for coding that I hope I can continue to have myself.  Eric is one of the main guys at Austin .NET Users Group and we were comparing notes about how to reach the most people to grow attendance for our groups.  His group has had 2 Code Camps and they have been VERY successful.  My group, AlamoCoders, only started back in March of this year and we're averaging 20-25 people per meeting.  We finally received a good location and I hope we can drive attendance.  Sorry, I digress.</p>
<p>It is my goal to learn this weekend and also to contribute.  I am not shy.  I love debate and hope to converse with some of the most intelligent people I have ever met this weekend.  The theme of this post was <strong>passion</strong>.  I am EXCITED about being in a building with people who have the same if not more <strong>passion</strong> that I do.  I foresee good debate, conversation and brainstorming occurring this weekend.</p>
<p>More to come...</p>

                <p>In my current environment We have the following:  </p>
<p>Developers<br>
System Analysts : QA Testers<br>
Business Analysts : Domain Experts  </p>
<p>Every morning at 9am we have our daily stand-up/scrum to enlighten the whole team and let everyone know what is going on.  We have a schedule sheet that dictates the primary organizer that week and who their backup is.  This week it is my duty.  I had it a couple of times last week also because the primary was off work or was handling a critical business item.  Either way we had stand-up coverage.  If both people are out, the following week's primary is next in line, etc.  You get the idea.</p>
<p>Our list of items to discuss with all groups present is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resources <ol>
<li>Development </li>
<li>Systems </li>
<li>Business</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Production Support (usually 1 infrastructure team member and 1 developer) </li>
<li>Build Status  (Iteration and Release updates) <ol>
<li>Development </li>
<li>Systems </li>
<li>Business</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Administrative Items (managers)</li>
</ol>
<p>This has worked out really well to enlighten everyone in all groups.  Does anyone have something similar or close?</p>
<p>After that session, which ends usually around 9:10-9:15, then we have individual group stand-ups.</p>
<p>For the developers group we do the age-old list:</p>
<ol>
<li>What did you work on the previous business day? </li>
<li>What are you currently working on or will work on? </li>
<li>Do you have any obstacles or pending information inquiries directed to the domain experts?</li>
</ol>
<p>This has also worked out really well.</p>
<p>When we started the developer stand-ups they would drag out due to other developers asking questions and other such things and we would lose track of time.  Joe (<a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo">agilejoe</a>), my <strike>manager</strike> agile coach, decided to use cooking timers.  Each developer has ~1 minute to answer the 3 questions above.  Timer goes off or you are done, then you pass the timer on.</p>
<p>What does everyone else do?  Remember, we are in a "corporate" XP/Scrum environment and this has been our "solution".</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/stand-ups/#152" title="2007-10-05 01:12:31">Christopher Bennage</a>:</strong> I heard a spot on NPR a few years back that suggested we do away with the term Boss, because a boss is someone big baddy you have to fight at the end of a level. They recommended the label Strategy Guide. This really only applies to those of us who grew up on video games.</p>

                <p>**Precursor: My MonoRail posts will continue soon, but I'm moving my office and have also had the "tech support" calls from friends and family lately, hence the OS, hardware posts.  We all have to do this stuff at sometime, right?  The services and CC.NET posts were because I'm managing our web server.</p>
<p>My next door neighbor's computer crashed.  As as we all know, if you are in the industry, you are a tech support person by default.</p>
<p>This post is for anyone googling about how to remove a hard drive from the Dell Dimension 3000:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="posts/dell-dimension-3000-remove-hard-drive/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03DellDimension3000removeharddrive_5C7A/image_thumb_1.png"></p>
<p>I googled and found nothing.  I resorted to the <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim3000/en/SM/parts.htm">online documentation</a> and Dell actually had it there.  A hard drive is a hard drive, but when you open this case you can see the 4 screws you need to remove and also the power button cord you need to disconnect from the motherboard and it still won't remove the bay, you start to wonder.  What you don't see is something I would have never guessed or found if I had not looked at the manual:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="posts/dell-dimension-3000-remove-hard-drive/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03DellDimension3000removeharddrive_5C7A/image_thumb_2.png"></p>
<p>Notice the screw on the bottom?  That was why I couldn't remove the bay.  Maybe this is my first hard drive bay like this, but it was interesting.</p>

            <div class="body">
                <p>Why? I am currently hosting CruiseControl for an open-source project and I don't want my personal projects to show up on their web dashboard.  I also want a complete separation.  That means theirs is running on its own port number and they have their own Virtual Directory (ccnet) on the Default website. The given CruiseControl.msi file does an excellent job of setting up the first CruiseControl service and virtual directory for you.  I won't go into this much, but you will learn a little bit about what it does because I'm installing my instance manually. </p>
<h3>FILE STRUCTURE</h3>
<p>1. First (easiest way), copy the folder structure created by the msi install and copy it to another folder. <img alt="image" src="posts/installing-2-cruisecontrol-services-web-dashboards-on-1-server-pc/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb.png"> copies to <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_1.png"></p>
<h3>SERVICE</h3>
<p>1. Next edit the following files and the specific lines in your new folder structure: ...CruiseControl.NET2/server/ ccnet.exe.config : Change the port to a new port (default was 21234) ccservice.exe.config : Change the port to a new port (default was 21234) (both files have the following schema) <img alt="image" src="posts/installing-2-cruisecontrol-services-web-dashboards-on-1-server-pc/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_2.png"> 4. Create your new CruiseControl.NET Server service Currently you should have the following in your services manager (Start-&gt; Run: services.msc) (I'm a keyboard junkie, I use Start-&gt;Run for mostly everything) <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_3.png"> Now if you run the following command in the command line you will create another service for your new CruiseControl.NET Server: <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_6.png"> This is using the service command (<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810435.aspx">details here</a>) to install the new service via command line. ***BEWARE:  You have to leave a space after the equals signs or you will get a usage notice (error).  Took me a while to figure that one out. Here is what you should see inside the properties dialog of the new service. <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_5.png"> You should be able to right click the service and choose start.  If you receive an error, be sure to check the ccservice.exe.config file and that the port is different than your other service that is most likely already started.  This is a common error for not starting. <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_4.png"></p>
<h3>WEB DASHBOARD</h3>
<p>1. Edit the ...CruiseControl.NET2webdashboarddashboard.config file with the new port number: Change tcp://localhost:21234/CruiseManager.rem to tcp://localhost:<yourport>/CruiseManager.rem <img alt="image" src="posts/installing-2-cruisecontrol-services-web-dashboards-on-1-server-pc/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_7.png"> 2. Create a new virtual directory on your server/PC for your new dashboard: <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_8.png"> Outside of the default settings created by creating a new Virtual Directory, be aware of the following: <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_10.png"> Local path: C:Program FilesCruiseControl.NET2webdashboard Execure Permissions: Scripts only I also use a unique Application Pool for all my Virtual Directories and Sites. I created a CCNet App Pool for this and my other ccnet Virtual Directory. <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_11.png"> Default Document: default.aspx <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_12.png"> Make sure the site is using ASP.NET 2.0 This should be all you need. When you type: <a href="http://localhost/ccnet2">http://localhost/ccnet2</a> <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_13.png"> Just be aware that when you want to use the latest CCTray, you will need to include the port number if you are going to connect via remoting: <img alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03/Installing2CruiseControlserviceswebdashb_EB50/image_thumb_14.png"> Connection for dashboard: <a href="http://localhost/ccnet2">http://localhost/ccnet2</a> Connection for .NET remoting: localhost:43555 I haven't used the last one but for those out there that need to, you can connect to non-CruiseControl.NET build servers (CruiseControl for Java).   I know this is brute force and I'm open to all suggestions for a more elegant solution. I'm blogging this for memory and for anyone else who might need it.</yourport></p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/installing-2-cruisecontrol-services-web-dashboards-on-1-server-pc/#137" title="2007-10-03 12:32:07">Jimmy Bogard</a>:</strong> I recently had to do this also, as we have different service accounts for each environment we deploy to. I had to create a different CC.NET service for each service account, but I kept just the one dashboard to monitor all of them. In that case, I just copied the "server" folder inside the CruiseControl.NET folder. But by creating separate dashboards, you can also apply separate IIS authentication and NTFS permissions to each set of CCNET servers it monitors, to give some level of security over who can set off builds.</p>

<p>We have successfully upgraded <a href="http://www.lostechies.com">LosTechies</a> to Community Server 2008.  We are sporting a new theme and will be changing a couple little things here and there.  Thank you to all our readers for allowing us to give back to community.  One of our members was overheard saying that a major key point of LosTechies is to give back to the community more than we take from it.  We have recently expanded to another member outside the continental United States (<a href="http://colinjack.lostechies.com">Colin Jack of Edinburgh, Scotland</a>) and have also brought on another fellow Texan (<a href="http://derickbailey.lostechies.com">Derick Bailey of McLane Advanced Technologies near Austin</a>).  We will keep growing and helping to shape the software development community in positive ways.</p>
<p>You will also notice that we are now listing our sponsors and blogs on the right hand side of the most prominent pages of our site now.  We hope you are able to navigate to our member's blogs a little easier and also be aware of a few companies that have supported us in our cause to help improve the software industry and ourselves by being a fellow follower of Pablo the donkey.</p>
<p>All hail Pragmatic Pablo!</p>

<p>I am currently interacting with 64 bit registry entries from a 32-bit application so I'm having to resort to DllImports.  Fun fun.</p>
<p>I came across this line in the MSDN entry of RegOpenKeyEx:  </p>
<p>"<em>A single registry key can be opened only 65534 times. When attempting the 65535th open operation, this function fails with ERROR_NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES.</em>"<br>
(In the Remarks section of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724897%28VS.85%29.aspx">here</a>) </p>
<p>Just thought it was funny.</p>
<p>What's not funny, is that I'm having to write this code in .NET 1.1 due to clients not willing to upgrade their servers to at least .NET 2.0.  The horror.  </p>
<p>Side Note:  I have 2 posts coming.  One on using Microsoft Sandcastle to automate chm generation from API code (where comments are acceptable in my code) and another on MSI generation using WiX.  Coming soon.</p>

<p>I've been using a MacBook Pro for about three months now.  Absolutely amazing.  No issues.</p>
<p>I use QuickSilver with a ctrl+space keystroke to bring it up.  If anyone has use Windows+R or Mac's spotlight, this is equivalent with a little bit more indexing power (IMO).</p>
<p>Well I'm doing some development on my Ubuntu VM and hate using alt+F2 because of the naming.  For example, by default it's "gnome-terminal" to bring up a terminal, and with <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/?q=content/download">Gnome-Do</a>, it's simply Term+press enter.  Less keystrokes are better in my opinion.</p>
<p>I was loading a terminal window in my session upon login, but with Gnome-Do I have much more power.</p>
<p>Donate if you use it.  Keep this going.   </p>
<p>NOTE: Follow the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GnomeDo/Installation">instructions</a> to a "T".  If you sudo apt-get the app without adding the new repositories, you won't get the preferences app.  Hardy Heron's repository is out of date.</p>

<p><em>Update: MEF == Managed Extensibility Framework</em></p>
<p>Read <a href="http://hammett.castleproject.org/?p=312#comment-62594">here</a>.  I couldn't believe until I read it.  He will be a Program Manager for MEF (Microsoft Entity Framework, I'm assuming?).  This is a VERY good thing.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/hammett-joins-microsoft/#277" title="2008-07-16 11:05:47">Sean Chambers</a>:</strong> wow. my jaw literally hit the ground when I read this. Looks like they're pulling out the big guns. Definately a good thing though as you stated. I wonder if they will only allow him to blog about the entity framework and not his open source project anymore like other recently hired MS employees? Probably not the case, but I saw an opportunity to make a stab =)</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/hammett-joins-microsoft/#278" title="2008-07-16 19:58:18">Derick Bailey</a>:</strong> MEF = Managed Extensibility Framework, not "entity framework". http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mef I hope Castle does not fall by the wayside with him moving into the MS realm.</p>

<p>I may be late on the band wagon on this one, but I just had the privilege of reading Karl Seguin's free e-book, <a href="http://www.openmymind.net/FoundationsOfProgramming.pdf">"Foundations of Programming"</a>.  This is what Alt.NET is all about.</p>
<p>Even if you disagree with Alt.NET or what it stands for, please just take a glance at it.  Karl is very good at re-emphasizing Joe Ocampo's favorite two words, "It depends...".</p>
<p>Remember, there is no silver bullet.  This book at least gives you knowledge.  Enjoy. </p>
<p>Kudos to Karl.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/free-e-book-from-karl-seguin/#273" title="2008-07-11 20:56:02">jlockwood</a>:</strong> Nice, I glanced over it and the content looks interesting...thanks for the heads up!</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/free-e-book-from-karl-seguin/#274" title="2008-07-12 03:06:36">Karl</a>:</strong> Thanks for the kind words. Lat is good, it spreads out the loads and increases the likelihood that those who missed the flurry will catch it. Sooner than later (can't imagine any more than 1 week), I plan on releasing something to help those who are more hands-on, or really anyone who might like to see a more end-to-end example. It'll be simple (which is always a problem since most of what we preach has a relatively high up-front cost which doesn't seem justifiable on small projects), but hopefully some will find value in it. Cheers, Karl</p>

<p>Thanks for tagging me <a href="http://joeybeninghove.lostechies.com">Joey.</a></p>
<p><strong>How old were you when you started programming?</strong></p>
<p>I was 11 years old (6th grade) when I started using QBasic to make easy games.  I actually knew about the easter egg that showed the developer names. </p>
<p><strong>What was your first language?</strong></p>
<p>Like Joey I used to write basic apps with QBasic and even mimicked a Windows Blue screen for fun.  I also used to code my TI calculators for games  when I was bored.  Pascal was my first third generation language for school and then hopped to ANSI C and C++.  Java and C# followed.  Python and Ruby are my new study items.****</p>
<p><strong>What was the first real program you wrote?</strong></p>
<p>Mentioned above .  It was games written in QBasic.  For friends and family.****</p>
<p><strong>If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?</strong></p>
<p>Most definitely.  This is one of those industries where you get to learn about other industries.  You get this because you write software for them. :) </p>
<p><strong>If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>The easiest answer is to go read "Pragmatic Programmer" by Hunt and Thomas, then go pair program with someone with Agile (Scrum/XP) experience.  I'm not trying to start an Agile flame war, but in my personal experience it works.</p>
<p><strong>What's the most fun you've ever had ... programming?</strong></p>
<p>The current team I'm on successfully wrote an internal web app for our mortgage company, with 6000+ unit tests, pair programming, continuous integration, and other little goodies.  The best part: project finished ahead of schedule, under budget, with zero defects, and a VERY happy end user.  That is fun.  Lasted almost a year.  </p>

<p>I had some slow issues with Virtual Box, which I've heard have been fixed.  I'm heading back down the VMWare path and did some research first.</p>
<p>I found this <a href="http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/05/03/install-vmware-server-105-on-ubuntu-804-hardy/">post</a> and tried it out.  It worked great.  My VMs are moving at my required speed now.  The latest version of VMWare 1.06 still requires some bash shell work.  This post gets you setup good.  </p>
<p>I'm running Virtual Studio 2008, Re# 4.0 (latest nightly build), and a couple other apps. </p>
<p>Using virtual machines have become the development de facto.  I'm finally getting back into the grove with ASP.NET MVC and some ExtJS stuff at work. (THANK GOD).  We've brought in the latest Rhino Mocks (3.5) and Castle Windsor.  Fun stuff ahead.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/getting-vmware-server-working-on-ubuntu-8-04-hardy-heron/#270" title="2008-06-04 11:31:04">schambers</a>:</strong> We recently purchased a new box at work to run 8 virtual machine instances in vmware. It was a beefy machine (3 ghz dual quad-core proc, 16gb of memory etc.) The problem came when we tried to hook up the virtual machines to our fiber channel SAN. apparently vmware freaks out if you dont have the proper product version to support fiber channel. Other than that, these instances are super fast. Vmware is does amazingly well with memory management. We have tried to bog down that box and are having a hard time thus far.</p>

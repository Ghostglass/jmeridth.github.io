title: Run a Specific RSpec Spec

Tired of looking this up and want to use my writing part of my brain to blog it:

```bash
rake spec SPEC=spec/controllers/sessions_controller_spec.rb \
  SPEC_OPTS="-e \"should log in with cookie\""
```

This is importatnt to me while coding Rails because if I just run

```bash
rspec specs/controllers/sessions_controller_spec.rb
```

the test database isnâ€™t cleared out. By running `rake spec` I get that.

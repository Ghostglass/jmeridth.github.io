<p>The most significant change that I like is the ability to setup expectations on void methods with Expect.Call.  Check out Oren's other post about this <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/17/Rhino-Mocks-Void-methods-using-Expect.Call.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>I was one of the developers that installed the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/asp.net/Aa336618.aspx">Web Application Projects MSI</a> before Visual Studio Service Pack 1 was available.  After the service pack came out, I didn't uninstall the MSI and just installed the SP.  We all know and heard the horror stories on how long it took to install SP 1.</p>
<p>Well, today I was finally getting my CI server going for my personal MonoRail project and came across this error:  </p>
<p>C:devJasonMeridthDotComtrunkJasonMeridthJasonMeridth.csproj(144,11): error MSB4019: The imported project "C:Program FilesMSBuildMicrosoftVisualStudiov8.0WebApplicationsMicrosoft.WebApplication.targets" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.</import></p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mnissen/archive/2006/06/19/Building-Web-Application-Projects-with-CCNET.aspx#comments">this</a> blog entry by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mnissen/default.aspx">mnissen</a>, I moved the targets file to my solution and fixed the csproj file.  I can't believe that it would get installed into a local Program Files directory, but that is just me.</p>
<p>I realize this is a "hack" for now.  I will be uninstalling Service Pack 1 and uninstalling the MSI, then re-installing the Service Pack, but this works for now.</p>
<p>Just wanted to share in case anyone else with this problem needs it.</p>
<p>Side Note:  I'll be blogging about code soon.  Evan is making us all look like slackers. :)</p>

<p>I have started using <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> instant messaging.  It consolidates my Google Talk, MSN Messenger, and Yahoo Accounts.  I've used <a href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a> in the past with success but it doesn't include Google Talk.  I also have <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> for voice messaging.  I hope Pidgin can include that someday.</p>

<p><strong><a href="posts/pidgin-instant-messaging/#166" title="2007-10-24 13:55:29">Garo Yeriazarian</a>:</strong> I use Pidgin as well, I've been using it since it was called Gaim.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/pidgin-instant-messaging/#167" title="2007-10-24 14:34:26">Chris Patterson</a>:</strong> I use Adium and Skype. It sure would be nice if Skype was more open to integrate with Adium but I guess that is why Skype works almost everywhere - even places that block most regular im clients.</p>
<p><strong><a href="posts/pidgin-instant-messaging/#168" title="2007-10-24 15:09:00">Jason Meridth</a>:</strong> I love Pidgin because it works in Ubuntu (Linux) also. :) I forgot that Pidgin was the Gaim rename. @Chris, I'll have to check out Adium. Thanks.</p>

<p>In response to Joe Ocampo's (AgileJoe) <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/10/20/curious-what-does-your-day-look-like.aspx">question</a>:</p>
<p>My typical day. </p>
<ul>
<li>5:30 Wake-up </li>
<li>5:45 Wake-up wife, start taking care of son</li>
<li>5:45-7:00 Feed him, smile when he gives me his morning "present" (a doody diaper), and change him </li>
<li>7:00 Take him to daycare </li>
<li>7:30 Get to work </li>
<li>Throughout business day I catch up on blog posts (<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10911683354881063158">my Google reader shared items</a>) and write some of my own drafts while waiting for our 6,000+ unit test suite to run.  I also check email to answer <a href="http://www.alamocoders.net/">AlamoCoders</a> or non-posting questions for LosTechies.  I work with my wife, so I usually have lunch with her. </li>
<li>5:00PM Leave, pick up son from daycare </li>
<li>5:30 Feed and spend time with family </li>
<li>6:30-7:00 Bathe and take son to bed </li>
<li>7:00 Code or write blog entries (I get 3 hours and possibly more after I spend time with wife] </li>
<li>10:00-12:00 Spend time with wife and go to bed (this can change if I have presentation or commitment)</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2nd week of the month is the <a href="http://www.alamocoders.net/">AlamoCoders</a> monthly meeting, so it is pretty hectic.</p>
<p>The last 2 months I've done the <a href="http://www.devcares.com">DevCares</a> session in San Antonio also.<br>
<img alt="Microsoft DevCares" src="posts/my-typical-day/jasonmeridth/files/2011/03MyTypicalDay_13735/image_3.png"></p>
<p>This following week is especially hectic:<br>
Top things to do:</p>
<p>1. Figure out why my CI server is not liking my "get latest" from <a href="http://www.svnrepository.com">svnrepository.com</a> (it's something I'm doing, not svnrepository.com)<br>
2. Ensure that all the guys on the team I'm on have access to the new SVN repository I created for our MonoRail sessions next week.<br>
3. Grok <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org">NHibernate</a><br>
4. Finish reading "<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10911683354881063158">Herding Cats</a>" - EXCELLENT book so far.<br>
5. Finish (the never ending task) and grok <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">DDD book.</a><br>
6. Prepare for LINQ DevCares (If you're in San Antonio, <a href="https://www.clicktoattend.com/invitation.aspx?code=121286">sign-up here</a>, It's FREE)<br>
etc.</p>

Looking forward to it! Another guy at work upgraded last week I believe</p>

<p>According to the recent check-in on MonoRail (build 586), they are setting the foundation to having routing just like ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>Very cool.  </p>

<p>1. My 2GB USB key drive has been bent for about 1 week so I almost bought a 4GB at Fry's last weekend for $89.  I hesitated and it's a good thing.  I went to CompUSA today and saw that they were selling 4GB SanDisk Cruzers for $39.  I went and got one.  To re-iterate what <a href="http://www.jeffreypalermo.com">Jeffrey Palermo</a> <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2007/06/25/modify-and-restore-firefox-extensions-that-fail-to-load.aspx">said</a>, I loaded the <a href="http://portableapps.com/">PortableApps</a> suite.</p>
<p>2. While I was there I got a 300 Watt ATX power supply for my home server.  It went out about 2 months ago and I haven't need the box until recently.  I replaced the power supply and was able to access my home server once again.</p>
<p>3. I finished the chapter "Framework for integration tests: Beauty Through Fragility" in the "Beautiful Code" book.  I started it at 9am this morning and finished it.  (Please be aware that I have a 2 year old and a dirty house, cleaning and playing with my son were part of the day too).</p>
<p>4. I also reloaded my first Mac.  One of my wife's co-workers has a G4 powerbook and it would boot up and then just sit on the apple screen.  I had to learn how to boot to CD first (hold down the letter "c" when the laptop is turned on).  Once the restore CD boots, it will boot straight to a reinstall screen.  It looks a lot like a Linux live CD; it had the look of the normal Mac desktop.  Throughout the file menu there was an option to scan the hard disk and repair if there were any errors.  It failed.  I formatted from that very same tool (all GUI) and then started the reload.  It worked and the laptop is ready to go.</p>
<p>For all the non-Mac people out there:  to right-click, all you have to do is hold down the "ctrl" key when you click the mouse button. :)</p>
<p>5.  I finally posted my next to last ALT.net conference summation post, my last one is coming soon.</p>
<p>6. I wired-up the email sender for my personal MonoRail site.  This was after trying to write the unit test.  I finally succeeded and it was VERY easy with BaseControllerTest involved.  I'll explain in my next MonoRail post.</p>
<p>A nerdy afternoon/evening.  A good one.</p>

<p><strong>2 notes on the Captcha module:<br>
</strong>1. From research, Brendan's Captcha module is the best one out there for CS 2007.<br>
2. If you are a member (logged-in) to the CS blogs, you won't see the Captcha module.  It is used for individuals who are not logged-in (trusted) to the site.</p>
<p>Kudos to Brendan.</p>

<p>I apologize for the delay of this post.  It was a great weekend and I learned a great deal about other developers and myself.  It has also made me hit the code harder.  I don't know how Oren or </p>
<h5>BREAKFAST</h5>
<p>I had a chance to meet with some developers while eating breakfast. I had an opportunity to speak with <a href="http://www.drusellers.com">Dru Sellers</a>, added <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/MonoRail/gettingstarted/firstcontroller.html">siteroot</a> (it's equivalent to ~/ in ASP.NET, scroll down to "Creating the layout") to MonoRail, and <a href="http://blog.phatboyg.com/">Chris Patterson</a>.  They were both articulate, intelligent, and a blast to chat with.</p>
<p>Here they are: (Chris on left, Dru on right)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blog.phatboyg.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/chrisanddru.jpg"></p>
<p>Disclaimer: EVERY developer I had an opportunity to speak with was passionate, intelligent, excited about the sessions, and couldn't wait to get back to their teams/jobs to help spread the knowledge.  I will stop stating the same thing over and over about each of these people that I met.</p>
<p>While enjoying breakfast with <a href="http://codemonkey.nmonta.com/">Nelson</a> and <a href="http://blog.agilejoe.com">Joe</a>, Jay Flowers of <a href="http://www.cifactory.org/joomla/">CI Factory</a> walked up with one of the best shirts I saw all conference.</p>

<h5>SESSIONS</h5>
<p><strong>DSL</strong><br>
I sat in this one for about 5 minutes because when everyone started looking around an no one knew who convened the session I decided to go check out the "Passion" session.  On my way out, Martin Fowler and Scott Guthrie were headed in.  I did a double take before deciding to continue to the other session.</p>
<p><strong>PASSION</strong><br>
I walked into this session late.  I missed JP Boodhoo's intro (I really wish I hadn't, I heard it was good).  I listened for a while.  When <a href="http://blog.dashpoint.com/">Rod Paddock</a> asked, "How do you start passion amongst other team-mates or other teams you work with or user groups?", my alpha personality and loud voice kicked in.  I mentioned items like blogs and the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">"Pragmatic Programmer"</a> book by Thomas and Hunt.  I made the mistake of focusing on the tools and processes and if you notice the specific line from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>, "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools" you'll understand (I am in no means stating that processes or tools are useless - check out the last line "That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more").  I sometimes focus too much on the code.  Nothing makes me smile larger than beautiful code, but after this weekend I realized there is something more valuable:  watching another developer have that "aha" moment when they are coding, talking to another developer, etc.  It's priceless (and THAT is what the ALT.net [place fav label here</p>

<p>I agree with many others, a big thanks goes out to Scott and the other leaders of the ALT.net conference for putting it together.  It was weird being 1 of 100+ to "run" the conference. Open Spaces worked out really well.</p>
